1
00:00:00,123 --> 00:00:02,456
Precise timing test

2
00:00:02,456 --> 00:00:02,457
Single millisecond gap

3
00:00:02,457 --> 00:00:05,789
Another segment

4
00:00:05,789 --> 00:00:10,123
Longer duration segment

5
00:00:10,123 --> 00:00:10,124
Another millisecond precision

6
00:59:59,999 --> 01:00:00,000
Hour boundary crossing

7
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,001
Minimal duration

8
23:59:59,999 --> 23:59:59,999
Zero duration edge case
