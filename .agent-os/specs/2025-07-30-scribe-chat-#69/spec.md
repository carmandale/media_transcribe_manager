# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Scribe AI Research Assistant Chat System
> Created: 2025-07-30
> GitHub Issue: #69
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement an AI-powered conversational interface that enables historians and researchers to explore 726 Holocaust survivor interviews through natural language queries, providing accurate responses with precise citations and maintaining scholarly rigor while leveraging the existing search infrastructure.

## User Stories

### Historian Research Discovery

As a research historian, I want to ask natural language questions about interview content, so that I can discover relevant testimonies and insights without manually listening through hundreds of hours of interviews.

**Detailed Workflow:** User opens chat interface, types questions like "What stories do they have about the Eastern Front?" or "Who talked about feeling like a second-class person?", receives synthesized responses with direct quotes and citation links, clicks citations to jump to specific interview moments with synchronized video/transcript.

### Archive Curator Content Access

As an archive curator, I want users to be able to discover content through conversational exploration, so that our historical testimonies become more accessible and generate deeper engagement from researchers.

**Detailed Workflow:** Curator provides access to chat system, users explore content through natural conversation, system maintains accuracy through proper source attribution, curator can track usage patterns while preserving user privacy.

### Educational Institution Research

As an educational institution using testimonies for teaching, I want students to engage with primary sources through intuitive questioning, so that they can develop deeper understanding of historical events through personal narratives.

**Detailed Workflow:** Students ask questions about specific topics or themes, receive curated responses from multiple interviews, explore cross-connections between testimonies, cite specific moments for academic work with proper attribution.

## Spec Scope

1. **Data Pipeline Foundation** - Extract transcript content from existing SRT files and populate search infrastructure with rich interview data
2. **Chat Interface Implementation** - Build conversational UI integrated with existing Next.js viewer using consistent design patterns
3. **RAG System Architecture** - Implement retrieval-augmented generation using existing Fuse.js search as content retrieval engine
4. **Citation and Attribution System** - Create precise linking from chat responses to specific interview moments with timestamps
5. **Multi-Language Support** - Handle queries and responses in English, German, and Hebrew matching existing translation capabilities

## Out of Scope

- Advanced entity extraction and knowledge graph visualization (Phase 2 feature)
- Multi-user collaboration tools and shared annotations (Enterprise feature)
- Custom fine-tuned language models (using OpenAI GPT-4 for MVP)
- Real-time conversation analytics and user behavior tracking (basic usage metrics only)
- Mobile-specific optimizations beyond responsive design (desktop-first approach)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Working Chat Interface** - Users can ask questions about interview content and receive relevant, attributed responses within the existing Scribe viewer
2. **Content Discovery System** - All 726 interviews are searchable through natural language queries with proper citation linking to video/transcript moments
3. **Integrated User Experience** - Chat functionality seamlessly integrated with existing navigation and interview viewing capabilities
