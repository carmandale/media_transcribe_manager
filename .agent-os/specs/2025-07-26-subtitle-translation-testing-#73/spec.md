# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Subtitle Translation Testing
> Created: 2025-07-26
> GitHub Issue: #73
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive testing for the subtitle translation fix to ensure segment-by-segment language detection works correctly for mixed-language interviews. This spec validates PR #70's implementation before reprocessing all 728 interviews.

## User Stories

### Historian Accessing Mixed-Language Testimonies

As a historian researcher, I want to access interviews that contain multiple languages (German/English/Hebrew) with accurate translations, so that I can understand the complete testimony regardless of which language the interviewee switches to during their narrative.

When watching an interview where the speaker switches between German and English mid-sentence or uses Hebrew phrases, I expect the subtitle system to detect each language segment independently and provide accurate translations without assuming the entire interview is in one language.

### Archive Curator Ensuring Translation Quality

As an archive curator, I want to verify that our subtitle translation system correctly handles the complex language patterns in our 728 testimonies, so that we can confidently make these interviews accessible to researchers worldwide.

Before committing to reprocessing our entire collection, I need assurance through comprehensive testing that language switches, short segments, non-verbal sounds, and edge cases are all handled correctly.

## Spec Scope

1. **Mixed-Language Test Suite** - Create comprehensive tests for interviews containing multiple languages
2. **Segment Detection Verification** - Test segment-by-segment language detection accuracy
3. **Edge Case Coverage** - Handle short segments, non-verbal sounds, and mid-sentence language switches
4. **Batch Integration Testing** - Verify the system works at scale with multiple concurrent processes
5. **Performance Benchmarking** - Measure processing time and resource usage for full reprocessing

## Out of Scope

- Modifying the core translation algorithm (already implemented in PR #70)
- Adding new languages beyond English, German, and Hebrew
- Changing the viewer interface or subtitle display format
- Implementing new translation APIs or services

## Expected Deliverable

1. Complete test suite with 90%+ coverage of subtitle translation code paths
2. Verification that mixed-language interviews are correctly processed with segment-by-segment detection
3. Performance report showing the system can handle reprocessing 728 interviews efficiently
