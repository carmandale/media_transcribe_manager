These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-26-subtitle-translation-testing-#73/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-26
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Implement Test Suite Structure and Basic Test Coverage
  - [x] 1.1 Write test structure for subtitle translation module tests
  - [x] 1.2 Create test fixtures for various subtitle formats (SRT, VTT, ASS/SSA)
  - [x] 1.3 Implement basic translation functionality tests
  - [x] 1.4 Add test helpers for subtitle file parsing and validation
  - [x] 1.5 Verify all basic tests pass

- [x] 2. Add Mixed-Language Detection and Preservation Tests
  - [x] 2.1 Write tests for identifying mixed-language segments (e.g., [EN] text [ES] texto)
  - [x] 2.2 Create test cases for various language tag formats and edge cases
  - [x] 2.3 Implement tests for language preservation during translation
  - [x] 2.4 Add tests for proper segment reassembly after translation
  - [x] 2.5 Test handling of segments with multiple language switches
  - [x] 2.6 Verify all mixed-language tests pass

- [x] 3. Implement Edge Case and Error Handling Tests
  - [x] 3.1 Write tests for malformed subtitle files and invalid formats
  - [x] 3.2 Create tests for API rate limiting and retry logic
  - [x] 3.3 Implement tests for partial translation failures
  - [x] 3.4 Add tests for character encoding issues (UTF-8, UTF-16, etc.)
  - [x] 3.5 Test handling of empty segments and timing-only entries
  - [x] 3.6 Verify all edge case tests pass

- [ ] 4. Add Integration and Batch Processing Tests
  - [ ] 4.1 Write integration tests for the complete translation pipeline
  - [ ] 4.2 Create tests for batch processing multiple subtitle files
  - [ ] 4.3 Implement tests for concurrent translation operations
  - [ ] 4.4 Add tests for progress tracking and cancellation
  - [ ] 4.5 Test integration with different translation providers (GPT-4, Claude)
  - [ ] 4.6 Verify all integration tests pass

- [ ] 5. Implement Performance Benchmarking and Final Verification
  - [ ] 5.1 Write performance benchmark tests for translation speed
  - [ ] 5.2 Create memory usage profiling tests
  - [ ] 5.3 Implement load testing for concurrent operations
  - [ ] 5.4 Add comprehensive test documentation
  - [ ] 5.5 Run full test suite with coverage report
  - [ ] 5.6 Verify all tests pass with >90% code coverage
  - [ ] 5.7 Create test execution guide for future contributors
