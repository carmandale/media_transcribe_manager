# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-28-subtitle-first-architecture-#79/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-28
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Database Schema Evolution (Build Upon Existing)
  - [x] 1.1 Extend existing database tests to cover subtitle_segments table creation
  - [x] 1.2 Create database migration script that preserves existing transcript data
  - [x] 1.3 Implement subtitle_segments table alongside existing schema (additive)
  - [x] 1.4 Create views to maintain backward compatibility with current transcript access patterns
  - [x] 1.5 Write integration tests for combined transcript + segment workflows
  - [x] 1.6 Verify all database tests pass including existing transcript functionality

- [x] 2. Enhanced ElevenLabs Integration (Preserve Current Quality)
  - [x] 2.1 Extend existing ElevenLabs tests to cover word-level timestamp parsing
  - [x] 2.2 Enhance current API response parsing to capture additional timestamp data
  - [x] 2.3 Create database integration for storing timestamped segments alongside current transcript workflow
  - [x] 2.4 Preserve existing transcription quality while adding segment capability
  - [x] 2.5 Add fallback handling that maintains current behavior when timestamps unavailable
  - [x] 2.6 Verify enhanced integration doesn't break existing transcription functionality

- [ ] 3. Database-Coordinated Translation (Leverage Existing Quality)
  - [x] 3.1 Extend existing batch language detection tests (83% coverage) for segment coordination
  - [x] 3.2 Integrate database segments with existing DeepL translation workflow
  - [ ] 3.3 Preserve existing OpenAI Hebrew translation quality while adding segment storage
  - [ ] 3.4 Coordinate existing translation timing mechanisms with database segments
  - [ ] 3.5 Build upon existing translation quality validation rather than replacing
  - [ ] 3.6 Verify enhanced translation preserves all existing functionality and quality

- [ ] 4. Integrate with SRTTranslator Core (Build Upon Proven Foundation)
  - [ ] 4.1 Extend existing SRTTranslator tests (67% coverage) for database segment integration
  - [ ] 4.2 Coordinate database segments with existing SRT generation logic (preserve timing validation)
  - [ ] 4.3 Build upon existing segment boundary validation rather than replacing
  - [ ] 4.4 Enhance existing quality framework with database-backed metrics
  - [ ] 4.5 Integrate database segments with proven timing accuracy mechanisms
  - [ ] 4.6 Verify all SRTTranslator functionality preserved while adding database coordination

- [ ] 5. Strategic Pipeline Integration (Preserve Existing Architecture)
  - [ ] 5.1 Extend existing end-to-end tests to include database segment coordination
  - [ ] 5.2 Integrate database layer with existing processing pipeline without breaking current functionality
  - [ ] 5.3 Enhance existing error handling to include database segment rollback
  - [ ] 5.4 Extend existing progress tracking to include segment storage status
  - [ ] 5.5 Add database coordination to existing CLI commands (preserve current interface)
  - [ ] 5.6 Verify enhanced pipeline maintains all existing functionality while adding segment capability

- [ ] 6. Expand Existing Quality Infrastructure (Build Upon 67-83% Coverage)
  - [ ] 6.1 Extend existing performance test suite to include database segment operations
  - [ ] 6.2 Build upon existing comprehensive test framework for synchronization validation
  - [ ] 6.3 Expand existing edge case testing (leveraging current accent/speech handling)
  - [ ] 6.4 Enhance existing benchmarks to include database coordination overhead
  - [ ] 6.5 Use existing sample interview testing infrastructure for validation
  - [ ] 6.6 Maintain existing quality standards while adding database segment metrics

- [ ] 7. Documentation and Compatibility (Preserve Existing Interfaces)
  - [ ] 7.1 Extend existing compatibility tests to verify database integration doesn't break current workflows
  - [ ] 7.2 Document database coordination enhancements while preserving existing usage patterns
  - [ ] 7.3 Document database features as additive capabilities to existing CLI interface
  - [ ] 7.4 Update troubleshooting guide to include database segment coordination
  - [ ] 7.5 Document database integration alongside existing codebase rather than replacing
  - [ ] 7.6 Verify all documentation reflects strategic refactor approach rather than complete rewrite
