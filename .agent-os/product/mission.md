## The Problem

### Language Barriers in Historical Research

Historians often cannot access crucial testimonies because they're in languages they don't understand. This limits research to scholars who speak specific languages, creating gaps in historical understanding.

**Our Solution:** Automated transcription and translation into English, German, and Hebrew.

### Time-Intensive Manual Processing

Transcribing and translating hours of interviews manually takes months or years. This makes large-scale testimony preservation projects impractical for most institutions.

**Our Solution:** Automated pipeline processing hundreds of interviews with quality evaluation.

### Difficulty Finding Specific Content

Researchers waste hours listening through interviews to find specific topics or mentions. Traditional video players don't allow searching within spoken content.

**Our Solution:** Searchable transcripts synchronized with video playback and upcoming chat interface.

## Differentiators

### Historical Context Preservation

Unlike generic transcription services, we optimize for historical accuracy and context. Our system evaluates translation quality specifically for historical testimonies, ensuring names, places, and events are correctly preserved.

### Multi-Language First Design

Unlike tools that add translation as an afterthought, we built Scribe specifically for multi-language access. Users can seamlessly switch between original audio and translated subtitles in German, English, or Hebrew while watching.

### Research-Focused Interface

Unlike consumer video platforms, we provide tools historians need: synchronized transcripts, precise timestamps for citations, and (upcoming) AI-powered chat for asking historical questions with interview references.
