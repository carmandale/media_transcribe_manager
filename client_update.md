# Scribe System Update - January 2025

## Progress Update for Historical Interview Preservation

Dear Dr. Rigg and Research Team,

I'm pleased to provide an update on the recent improvements to the Scribe system that will enhance your research experience.

### What We've Improved

**Subtitle Accuracy Enhancement**
We've completed a major architectural improvement focused on ensuring perfect synchronization between the spoken word and the subtitles you see on screen. This means:

- **More Precise Timing**: Subtitles now appear exactly when words are spoken, making it easier to follow along with testimonies
- **Better Language Switching**: When interviewees switch between German, English, and Hebrew, the subtitles maintain proper alignment
- **Preserved Historical Context**: Names, places, and dates are now even more accurately synchronized with the moment they're spoken

### What This Means for Your Research

1. **Easier Citation**: With improved subtitle timing, you can more accurately cite specific moments in testimonies
2. **Better Comprehension**: The enhanced synchronization makes following multi-language interviews much smoother
3. **Reliable Translations**: All three languages (German, English, Hebrew) now maintain consistent timing accuracy

### Current Status

- ✅ All 728 interviews remain fully accessible
- ✅ The new subtitle synchronization system is fully operational
- ✅ Quality validation has been completed on the enhancement

### Next Steps

We're now beginning comprehensive testing to ensure these improvements work flawlessly across all interviews in your collection. This testing phase will verify that every interview maintains the highest quality standards for subtitle accuracy.

### No Action Required

The system continues to work exactly as before from your perspective - simply select your preferred language and the improved subtitles will display automatically. All your existing bookmarks and references remain valid.

Thank you for your patience as we continue to enhance the Scribe system to better serve your important historical research.

Best regards,
The Scribe Development Team
