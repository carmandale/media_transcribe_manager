# Integration Testing Suite

This comprehensive testing suite validates the production readiness of the advanced search functionality and admin backend.

## 🎯 Testing Strategy

### Phase: Integration Testing & Validation
**Goal**: Ensure rock-solid reliability with real data and comprehensive validation  
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks  
**Focus**: Performance, reliability, security, and user experience validation

## 📋 Test Categories

### 1. Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)
- **Purpose**: Validate search functionality with real data from `manifest.min.json`
- **Coverage**: 726 real German historical interviews
- **Tests**: Search engine performance, data validation, filter functionality
- **Run**: `npm run test:integration`

### 2. Performance Tests (`tests/performance/`)
- **Purpose**: Validate system performance under various load conditions
- **Coverage**: Response times, memory usage, concurrent users, large datasets
- **Tests**: Search speed, indexing performance, stress testing
- **Run**: `npm run test:performance`

### 3. End-to-End Tests (`tests/e2e/`)
- **Purpose**: Validate complete user workflows
- **Coverage**: Gallery search, dedicated search page, result interaction
- **Tests**: User journeys, responsive design, error handling
- **Run**: `npm run test:e2e` (requires dev server)

### 4. Security Tests (`tests/security/`)
- **Purpose**: Validate admin authentication and security measures
- **Coverage**: API key validation, authorization, attack prevention
- **Tests**: Authentication flows, security headers, injection prevention
- **Run**: `npm run test:security`

### 5. Edge Case Tests (`tests/edge-cases/`)
- **Purpose**: Ensure system resilience with malformed data and error conditions
- **Coverage**: Malformed data, missing files, extreme inputs
- **Tests**: Error handling, data corruption, performance edge cases
- **Run**: `npm run test -- --testPathPattern=edge-cases`

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **For E2E Tests** (optional):
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

### Run Complete Integration Testing Suite
```bash
npm run test:integration-suite
```

This command runs all test categories and generates comprehensive reports.

### Run Individual Test Categories
```bash
# Integration tests with real data
npm run test:integration

# Performance testing (requires dev server)
npm run test:performance

# Security and authentication tests
npm run test:security

# Edge case and error handling tests
npm run test -- --testPathPattern=edge-cases

# End-to-end tests (requires dev server)
npm run test:e2e
```

## 📊 Performance Thresholds

The performance tests validate against these production-ready thresholds:

- **Search Response Time**: ≤ 5 seconds
- **Memory Usage**: ≤ 512MB
- **Concurrent Users**: 10 simultaneous users
- **Large Dataset**: 500+ interviews

## 🎯 Production Readiness Criteria

The testing suite evaluates production readiness based on:

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Unit Tests Pass | 20% | All unit tests pass successfully |
| Integration Tests Pass | 25% | Search functionality works with real data |
| Security Tests Pass | 20% | Admin authentication and security measures work |
| Edge Case Handling | 15% | System handles malformed data and error conditions |
| Performance Acceptable | 10% | Performance tests complete without errors |
| E2E Tests Pass | 10% | End-to-end user workflows work correctly |

**Production Ready**: Score ≥ 90/100  
**Minor Issues**: Score 75-89/100  
**Needs Work**: Score < 75/100

## 📄 Generated Reports

After running the integration suite, two reports are generated:

### 1. `TESTING_REPORT.md`
- Detailed test results for each suite
- Performance metrics and analysis
- Error logs and debugging information
- Test execution timeline

### 2. `PRODUCTION_READINESS.md`
- Overall production readiness score
- Specific recommendations for improvement
- Next steps for deployment
- Risk assessment and mitigation

## 🔧 Test Configuration

### Jest Configuration (`jest.config.js`)
- Next.js integration with `next/jest`
- TypeScript support with `ts-jest`
- JSDOM environment for component testing
- Custom module mapping for imports
- 30-second timeout for integration tests

### Playwright Configuration (`playwright.config.ts`)
- Multi-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile device testing
- Automatic dev server startup
- Screenshot and video capture on failure
- Trace collection for debugging

### Environment Setup (`jest.setup.js`)
- Mock Next.js router and navigation
- Test environment variables
- Global fetch mocking
- Performance API mocking
- Console error filtering

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Adding New Tests

1. **Integration Tests**: Add to `tests/integration/`
   - Test with real data from `manifest.min.json`
   - Focus on search functionality and data validation

2. **Performance Tests**: Add to `tests/performance/`
   - Include performance thresholds
   - Test with varying data volumes

3. **E2E Tests**: Add to `tests/e2e/`
   - Test complete user workflows
   - Include responsive design validation

4. **Security Tests**: Add to `tests/security/`
   - Test authentication and authorization
   - Include attack vector prevention

5. **Edge Case Tests**: Add to `tests/edge-cases/`
   - Test error conditions and malformed data
   - Include performance edge cases

### Test Data

- **Real Data**: Uses `public/manifest.min.json` (726 interviews)
- **Mock Data**: Generated programmatically for specific test scenarios
- **Edge Case Data**: Malformed and extreme data for robustness testing

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Dev Server Not Running** (for performance/E2E tests):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Then run tests in another terminal
   ```

2. **Playwright Browser Installation**:
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

3. **Memory Issues with Large Tests**:
   ```bash
   node --max-old-space-size=4096 tests/test-runner.js
   ```

4. **Test Timeouts**:
   - Increase timeout in `jest.config.js`
   - Check system performance
   - Verify test data availability

### Debug Mode

Run tests with verbose output:
```bash
npm run test -- --verbose
npm run test:integration -- --verbose
```

## 📈 Continuous Integration

For CI/CD integration:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run Integration Tests
  run: |
    npm install
    npm run build
    npm run test:integration-suite
    
- name: Upload Test Reports
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: test-reports
    path: |
      TESTING_REPORT.md
      PRODUCTION_READINESS.md
```

## 🎉 Success Criteria

- ✅ All test suites pass (score ≥ 90/100)
- ✅ Performance meets production thresholds
- ✅ Security measures validated
- ✅ Edge cases handled gracefully
- ✅ User workflows function correctly
