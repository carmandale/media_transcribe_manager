1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,480
Fast. At the beginning of the seventies. That just disappeared later.

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,082
As I said, when I was in the military

3
00:00:14,082 --> 00:00:19,082
I found out that I wasn't even allowed to become a non-commissioned officer.

4
00:00:19,082 --> 00:00:24,082
Unless it was for bravery in the face of the enemy. Why? Because of what?

5
00:00:24,082 --> 00:00:29,082
Because of my, uh-uh-uh, because I was a so-called quarter Jew.

6
00:00:29,082 --> 00:00:34,082
And how did you feel when you heard that? Uh, as a second-class person.

7
00:00:34,082 --> 00:00:34,958
Basically

8
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:39,958
it took me years after the war to get rid of these feelings of inferiority that it gave me.

9
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:44,958
And a lot of my activities later on were basically an attempt to prove that I could achieve something after all and that I wasn't inferior

10
00:00:44,958 --> 00:00:49,958
as people tried to make me believe at the time. Mhm.

11
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:54,958
And how did you overcome that? How did I overcome that? Yes.

12
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:59,958
That's not so easy to answer. It grew-- I gradually grew out of it-- Mhm.

13
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:04,958
-Later I felt that I was accepted by others and that I could achieve and do something.

14
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:09,958
Hm, hm. And back then you spoke to your mother and your brother.

15
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:14,958
Are we inferior - are we inferior? Is this ideology, is it the truth?

16
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:16,030
Wh-- How...

17
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:21,030
Were you very influenced by this new ideology, racial science and so on?

18
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,801
Uh, in terms of racial studies, I was against, uh

19
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:30,801
what was said in the Third Reich right from the start. Mhm.

20
00:01:30,801 --> 00:01:35,801
But, uh, these military successes, that's what impressed me as a boy, uh, uh.

21
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:36,190
Mhm.

22
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:41,190
And the, uh, conversations with my parents were always such that they were, uh, against the Nazis.

23
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,014
And so were my brother and I.

24
00:01:44,014 --> 00:01:49,014
But of course we weren't allowed to let them notice us.

25
00:01:49,014 --> 00:01:54,014
Nevertheless, as I said, we weren't completely uninfluenced.

26
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:58,006
We were in an intermediate position. Mmm.

27
00:01:58,006 --> 00:02:02,582
We were still too young to see through it. Mhm.

28
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:06,282
I was seventeen at the end of the war.

29
00:02:06,282 --> 00:02:11,282
I didn't have my eighteenth birthday until I was an American prisoner of war

30
00:02:11,282 --> 00:02:16,282
and then I was released at the beginning of forty-six, as an eighteen-year-old.

31
00:02:16,282 --> 00:02:20,177
Why didn't you try to forge your papers?

32
00:02:20,177 --> 00:02:24,169
Why didn't your mother actually try that?

33
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:29,169
Uh, because my grandfather was very well known and respected as a doctor in Karlsruhe.

34
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:34,169
And because it was known that he was Jewish, she would have had no chance of forging it.

35
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:39,169
I know about, uh, this father, this Melitta, um, they obviously managed to keep it secret.

36
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:44,169
Apparently none of these five, uh, siblings knew that the father was Jewish.

37
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:49,169
Hmm. But with your case, that was quite different. Yes.

38
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:53,259
And so in the military, at the draft. Yes.

39
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:58,259
Did you have to declare that you weren't pure Aryan? No.

40
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:03,259
So how did that come out? How did people find out about it?

41
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:07,640
And was the camaraderie in the military good?

42
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,640
Uh, that's actually one of the most valuable things I experienced in human terms back then.

43
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,924
You get to know people. (laughs softly) Mhm.

44
00:03:16,924 --> 00:03:21,924
You see who can't be influenced by something like that and who takes you seriously as a person and comrade (clears throat).

45
00:03:21,924 --> 00:03:22,314
Mhm.

46
00:03:22,314 --> 00:03:27,314
And others who behaved more or less contemptuously or who withdrew because they thought

47
00:03:27,314 --> 00:03:32,314
uh, if I have closer contact with him, it could harm me.

48
00:03:32,314 --> 00:03:37,314
My parents often told me about old acquaintances who, uh, in 1933

49
00:03:37,314 --> 00:03:39,651
from one day to the next

50
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:44,651
no longer greeted them on the street or no longer knew them.

51
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:49,651
And, uh, I grew up with this knowledge back then and also experienced it myself

52
00:03:49,651 --> 00:03:54,227
because some people withdrew and others didn't.

53
00:03:54,227 --> 00:03:58,609
But at least I experienced one positive case.

54
00:03:58,609 --> 00:04:03,609
It was during the war when a teacher, who now knew, er

55
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:08,609
that my grandfather was Jewish, said to my brother and me: "Go outside

56
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:13,609
I want to talk to the class." And then he, he was a party member

57
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:18,609
but he wasn't on the inside, he was only on the outside.

58
00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:23,609
And then he took the class and said: "What can they do about it?

59
00:04:23,609 --> 00:04:28,609
Take them in, let them be comrades, just like you." I gave the man a lot of credit for that.

60
00:04:28,609 --> 00:04:33,609
And did your, yes, student comrades actually do that?

61
00:04:33,609 --> 00:04:38,477
One of them objected at the time. And, uh, they...

62
00:04:38,477 --> 00:04:43,477
We noticed that, uh, not all of them, but some of them did behave a bit, uh

63
00:04:43,477 --> 00:04:46,009
more comradely towards us.

64
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:51,009
But through what, yes, through a what member, you say, right? Yes.

65
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:56,009
That actually gave you the feeling, didn't it? Still pity, sorry.

66
00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:01,009
Through pity, you would say, wouldn't you? Because they were ordered, actually.

67
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:06,009
Yes, yes, yes. But there was still a certain restraint.

68
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:11,009
People were no longer aggressive when I said that, some others were nevertheless, but passive.

69
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:16,009
But as I said, a few who did were completely impartial and friendly.

70
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:19,027
And you really appreciate that.

71
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:24,027
When Hitler came to the market, what did your parents tell you later about this

72
00:05:24,027 --> 00:05:29,027
yes, grasp of the market? Were your parents, were you very influenced by it?

73
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:31,948
Were you influenced by Hitler?

74
00:05:31,948 --> 00:05:36,948
Did you think that Hitler was our man for the future?

75
00:05:36,948 --> 00:05:41,948
My mother was strongly opposed from the beginning until the end.

76
00:05:41,948 --> 00:05:46,948
My father, like many men of that generation, was probably a bit more nationalistic.

77
00:05:46,948 --> 00:05:51,948
Not in a partisan sense, but that which is German is good and right

78
00:05:51,948 --> 00:05:56,948
roughly in terms of this attitude. And that's why he had a different attitude

79
00:05:56,948 --> 00:06:01,948
even though he was well aware of all the terrible things that were going on.

80
00:06:01,948 --> 00:06:06,948
But there were areas where he also admired the fact that unemployment was getting better

81
00:06:06,948 --> 00:06:11,948
for example, that France was overrun so quickly in the French campaign.

82
00:06:11,948 --> 00:06:16,948
That made him happy at the time. But what about the boys, yes? Yes.

83
00:06:16,948 --> 00:06:19,188
His boys too? Yes, yes.

84
00:06:19,188 --> 00:06:24,188
I was also influenced by this back then and I was happy too.

85
00:06:24,188 --> 00:06:29,188
Did anyone try to persuade your father to perhaps divorce his wife or leave his wife because of his Jewish ancestry?

86
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:34,188
I don't know about that. That was me... I don't know.

87
00:06:34,188 --> 00:06:38,180
My father and mother had a good marriage.

88
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:43,180
I don't think they ever thought of anything like that.

89
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,951
I only found out later that if my mother had died

90
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:52,951
she wouldn't have been allowed to be buried in the usual cemetery because she was half-Jewish.

91
00:06:52,951 --> 00:06:57,917
I don't know where she would have had to be buried.

92
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:02,917
There was obviously a decree at the time that forbade that.

93
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:07,917
And was it just you and your brothers who were so-called Mischlinge in that class?

94
00:07:07,917 --> 00:07:12,917
Did you get to know any other so-called half-breeds? Not in my class.

95
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:17,917
I did have one classmate in elementary school who was Jewish.

96
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:22,917
They then emigrated. A half-Jew, also a so-called half-Jew.

97
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:27,785
And later at grammar school we were the only ones.

98
00:07:27,785 --> 00:07:32,361
I only remember one who was one class below me.

99
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:37,361
He had to leave grammar school in the early forties.

100
00:07:37,361 --> 00:07:42,361
He was half, yes, to whom a brother and I were a quarter. What was his name?

101
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:47,361
Klaus Hermann, Dr. Klaus Hermann. He was a lawyer and, uh, came after the war

102
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:52,361
took the entrance exam for my class and we did our A-levels together.

103
00:07:52,361 --> 00:07:57,132
I think he was also in Theresienstadt. And, well.

104
00:07:57,132 --> 00:08:02,132
Can you quickly retell this story about your aunt and this Aryanization?

105
00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:04,761
It's very interesting. Yes.

106
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:09,761
And when did you - can you say when you found out about it?

107
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:14,761
I learned about it during the war. Okay. My mother's sister. What was her name?

108
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:17,488
Renate Schiller at the time.

109
00:08:17,488 --> 00:08:22,488
Um, she worked as a nurse during the war and was with a man who gave her a daughter.

110
00:08:22,488 --> 00:08:27,488
The man was deployed on the Eastern Front. What was his name? Ludwig Eitel.

111
00:08:27,488 --> 00:08:32,488
The marriage was subsequently declared as a marriage.

112
00:08:32,488 --> 00:08:37,488
That was possible at the time. Because he was a senior officer, wasn't he?

113
00:08:37,488 --> 00:08:42,488
He was a captain. Captain. He was then reported missing.

114
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:47,488
We never heard anything more about him, assuming that he was killed back then

115
00:08:47,488 --> 00:08:52,488
I think it was in '42. And now her name was Renate Eitel.

116
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:57,488
And a woman worked with her as a sister who was married to a high-ranking National Socialist

117
00:08:57,488 --> 00:09:02,488
which my aunt didn't know at the time. Do you know the names of the sons there?

118
00:09:02,488 --> 00:09:05,896
No, no, unfortunately I don't know.

119
00:09:05,896 --> 00:09:10,896
And she obviously applied for my aunt to be made an honorary Aryan without my aunt's knowledge.

120
00:09:10,896 --> 00:09:14,401
Without, uh, your aunt's child, yes?

121
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:19,401
Yes, that automatically means the child too, because if she's an honorary Aryan

122
00:09:19,401 --> 00:09:21,543
then the child is too.

123
00:09:21,543 --> 00:09:26,543
And was, um, she pregnant then or had you already had the child?

124
00:09:26,543 --> 00:09:31,543
The child had already been born and, uh, a few weeks later to her great surprise

125
00:09:31,543 --> 00:09:36,543
my aunt received a certificate in which she was named an honorary Aryan.

126
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:41,543
Uh, about eight days later she was summoned to the Gestapo because she had been denounced.

127
00:09:41,543 --> 00:09:45,048
She was in trouble from an institute

128
00:09:45,048 --> 00:09:50,048
I think it was a housing distribution office or something like that. Mhm.

129
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:54,527
Uh, she called these people a corrupt society.

130
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:59,006
And that's why she was summoned to the Gestapo

131
00:09:59,006 --> 00:10:04,006
but she took this certificate of honor with her as a precaution. Mhm.

132
00:10:04,006 --> 00:10:08,388
When she was in the office and was questioned

133
00:10:08,388 --> 00:10:12,867
she showed this honorary officer's certificate

134
00:10:12,867 --> 00:10:17,867
whereupon the Gestapo officer showed her a certificate stating that she had been sent to a concentration camp and then tore it up.

135
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:22,443
So this certificate practically saved her life.

136
00:10:22,443 --> 00:10:27,443
And when you found out about this Aryanization, what did you think about it?

137
00:10:27,443 --> 00:10:32,443
I was speechless. I didn't even think it was possible that such a thing existed.

138
00:10:32,443 --> 00:10:37,443
But I thought, good for her. You did - it's a shame we don't have it.

139
00:10:37,443 --> 00:10:42,443
Did you try to get that too? Because that was the sister. Yes. Yours-- Yes.

140
00:10:42,443 --> 00:10:43,417
My mother.

141
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:48,417
My mother obviously, obviously hadn't done anything, so we were left in the same state as before.

142
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:52,993
But did that give you a bit of hope or not? No.

143
00:10:52,993 --> 00:10:57,993
Did you think that was a one-off, or? We suspected that it must be very rare.

144
00:10:57,993 --> 00:11:02,569
Mmm. We'd never heard of it before and also, er

145
00:11:02,569 --> 00:11:07,569
only found out later in the post-war period that there were exceptional cases.

146
00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:07,959
Mhm.

147
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:12,959
For example, when I was a prisoner of war, I heard that Field Marshal Milch was a half-breed.

148
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,959
But that was the first case I, uh, heard about, apart from my own aunt. Hm.

149
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:21,269
Back to her military service. Yes.

150
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:26,269
When you were given a Wehrmacht uniform and you used it. Yes.

151
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:31,269
What did you think? I didn't have any particular thoughts.

152
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:36,269
I was aware that I was one of millions of others. I, uh- Did that help you?

153
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:41,269
Consciously, I mean. It was a bit of a protection. Mhm.

154
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:46,269
Uh, a protection, uh, not, uh, being able to be arrested so easily

155
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:51,138
since I now represent the state myself in uniform.

156
00:11:51,138 --> 00:11:56,138
That's how I felt at the time. Mhm. Was that really the case? Mm.

157
00:11:56,138 --> 00:12:00,909
And was your brother in the same company? No, no.

158
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:05,909
I was in the pioneers, armored engineers. He joined the artillery.

159
00:12:05,909 --> 00:12:10,909
And was his experience like your experience? Was he, uh...

160
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:14,122
I suppose more or less, yes. Mmm.

161
00:12:14,122 --> 00:12:19,122
Everyone feels differently, of course, but roughly the same.

162
00:12:19,122 --> 00:12:23,504
For example, when there were fights at school

163
00:12:23,504 --> 00:12:28,504
because someone thought he had to beat me up if possible.

164
00:12:28,504 --> 00:12:33,504
Then he always came to my aid, right. And, uh, so we had a sense of cohesion.

165
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:38,504
Mhm. And what did your comrades say they were fighting for?

166
00:12:38,504 --> 00:12:43,504
What did they fight for, yes? What reason did you give for that?

167
00:12:43,504 --> 00:12:48,504
Uh, the comrades said very little. That was the official propaganda

168
00:12:48,504 --> 00:12:53,504
which claimed that they were defending Greater Germany against this and that.

169
00:12:53,504 --> 00:12:58,504
Uh, that, uh, I actually, as soon as I became more aware, uh

170
00:12:58,504 --> 00:13:03,504
was able to think for myself in puberty, it was clear to me that that was, uh

171
00:13:03,504 --> 00:13:07,204
propaganda, exaggeration and nonsense.

172
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:12,204
Uh, I was actually already aware during the French campaign

173
00:13:12,204 --> 00:13:17,204
when they occupied Belgium and Holland, later Norway, uh

174
00:13:17,204 --> 00:13:22,204
and then later other countries, that they hadn't done anything to us.

175
00:13:22,204 --> 00:13:27,204
Why do you-- why do you do that? Or even the declaration of war on America.

176
00:13:27,204 --> 00:13:30,709
What chance do we have against that?

177
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:35,709
Of course I didn't tell anyone that, but I was already aware of how things were going.

178
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:40,709
And did your comrades feel like fighting? Some of them, yes. Hm.

179
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:45,709
And did you, yes, as a child, let's say, did you hope that Germany would win the war?

180
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:50,709
When I was young, at the beginning of the war, still more of a child, not yet an adolescent.

181
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:55,709
Back then, yes. But I mean in the military. No, no. For God's sake, no.

182
00:13:55,709 --> 00:14:00,709
There is-- I also remember that once an officer, uh, who probably belonged to a propaganda unit.

183
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:05,709
He gave lectures like that and the company was seconded and he spoke very suggestively and also talked about the final victory and the secret weapons and all that and then asked them how comradely they were.

184
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:10,709
Now everyone should say honestly whether they believe that this victory is not...

185
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:15,709
That this war could no longer be won. And not a single person came forward.

186
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:20,709
But I still remember feeling guilty because I didn't believe it and was too cowardly to say it.

187
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:25,709
That's how I thought at the time. Today I'm glad it was like that. Hm. Yes.

188
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:30,709
Please. Didn't you once say that you were happy when the flak hit? Yes.

189
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:35,709
That's right. Right? We were deployed as air force helpers. I was in a...

190
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:40,709
First in a ten-point-five-centimeter battery, later in an eight-point-eight-centimeter battery.

191
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:45,709
And there were the, um, American or English squadrons, when they moved over us and then...

192
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:50,709
The planes were shot at. We also saw planes crash several times.

193
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:55,709
And I saw that, uh, together with my comrades, as a success.

194
00:14:55,709 --> 00:15:00,709
And I was-- Because I also saw that, uh, these airplane attacks, uh

195
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:05,709
caused a lot of damage in Karlsruhe and other cities

196
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:10,709
and usually not to military objects, but to civilian buildings.

197
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:15,709
And how many planes did you shoot down? Or rather, the battery I was in.

198
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:20,709
Uh, officially, I think we were credited with two or three kills at the time.

199
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:25,709
But you know, I was able to observe that at the time. Uh

200
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:30,709
it depended a lot on which company commander was able to present the matter to the regimental commander as if it had been his battery.

201
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:31,585
As a rule

202
00:15:31,585 --> 00:15:36,585
there were always several batteries firing afterwards and it was never possible to determine exactly what caused the plane to crash.

203
00:15:36,585 --> 00:15:41,585
I was also lucky enough not to be at the cannon myself, but in the so-called defense tower.

204
00:15:41,585 --> 00:15:46,585
This was a section that was only deployed if the optical measuring device failed and the radio measuring device failed or vice versa.

205
00:15:46,585 --> 00:15:51,585
Then we had to pass on certain numbers and I never had to do that

206
00:15:51,585 --> 00:15:56,585
so I personally, uh, wasn't directly involved in the killing of another person.

207
00:15:56,585 --> 00:16:01,585
Not even later in the military. And today that's a...

208
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,604
I'm very glad about that today.

209
00:16:04,604 --> 00:16:09,604
Was your father, uh, your brother, was he in combat? For one, uh, two days.

210
00:16:09,604 --> 00:16:12,427
And what did he say about it?

211
00:16:12,427 --> 00:16:17,427
Uh, that they were heavily shot at, that comrades fell next to them.

212
00:16:17,427 --> 00:16:21,419
I don't know myself whether he fired too.

213
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:26,419
In any case, he was then taken prisoner. He was in the West, yes?

214
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:31,419
He was captured near Heilbronn and I was captured in Ulm.

215
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:34,633
Okay, so with the Americans. Yes.

216
00:16:34,633 --> 00:16:39,209
When did you find out about, uh, the Holocaust?

217
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:44,209
I found out about concentration camps relatively early on.

218
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:49,209
Uh, around 1942 or '43, I heard other people tell me, uh

219
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:54,209
that SS people had come on vacation who were in a very bad way and who had said that the concentration camps they were in were horrible.

220
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:59,209
But they weren't allowed to say anything because then they themselves might be

221
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:01,448
uh, sentenced to death.

222
00:17:01,448 --> 00:17:06,448
But it was so horrible that you couldn't say anything about it.

223
00:17:06,448 --> 00:17:11,448
And that's when I began to realize that the Jews, who everyone knew would one day be gone.

224
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:16,448
And not just the emigrants, we knew that they had left

225
00:17:16,448 --> 00:17:21,448
but that the others who had been sent to camps were not only doing very badly

226
00:17:21,448 --> 00:17:26,448
but it seemed likely to me at the time that these people had also been killed.

227
00:17:26,448 --> 00:17:31,448
I didn't know any more details, but I assume that if I

228
00:17:31,448 --> 00:17:36,448
as a fourteen-year-old or fifteen-year-old, heard that at the time

229
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:40,441
then other people must have heard it too.

230
00:17:40,441 --> 00:17:45,441
So if they kept saying later: "Yes, I have no idea." These people

231
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:49,433
they repressed it or they don't admit it.

232
00:17:49,433 --> 00:17:54,398
And, uh, also the threats with concentration camps.

233
00:17:54,398 --> 00:17:59,398
You didn't hear the name Auschwitz, but Dachau, for example

234
00:17:59,398 --> 00:18:04,398
was a well-known concentration camp whose name was heard more often.

235
00:18:04,398 --> 00:18:09,267
And, uh, in captivity... After the first few weeks

236
00:18:09,267 --> 00:18:14,267
after I came from the collection camp to a labor camp, that's when, uh

237
00:18:14,267 --> 00:18:17,967
we prisoners of war also became known.

238
00:18:17,967 --> 00:18:22,967
And then I was also astonished that it had been carried out on such a huge scale

239
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:27,641
that millions of people had been killed, and, uh

240
00:18:27,641 --> 00:18:32,641
at that time more than half of my German comrades dismissed it as American propaganda and said: "That can't be true." Hm.

241
00:18:32,641 --> 00:18:37,641
And after the war, did you ever feel guilty about what you did at the, at the flat, right?

242
00:18:37,641 --> 00:18:42,641
No, uh, not that. I, uh, I didn't see the big picture back then.

243
00:18:42,641 --> 00:18:47,641
I wasn't ashamed of it. I was ashamed of something else, though.

244
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:52,641
I wasn't just in an anti-aircraft battery, but later also in the Stab regiment

245
00:18:52,641 --> 00:18:57,641
and they also had Russian prisoners of war as auxiliaries. Mhm.

246
00:18:57,641 --> 00:19:02,641
And one of these Russian auxiliaries once offered me a job in arts and crafts if I could give him bread in return.

247
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:07,641
And I didn't do it and I'm still ashamed of that today.

248
00:19:07,641 --> 00:19:12,641
And during that time, did you lose any Jewish relatives in the Holocaust? No.

249
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:17,412
Hm. And with your aunt- Hai--, you knew that this

250
00:19:17,412 --> 00:19:22,412
this Aryanization was her salvation from the concentration camp man? Yes.

251
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:27,412
The Gestapo. Yes. Were you afraid for yourself that you would also be deported?

252
00:19:27,412 --> 00:19:32,412
Uh, I was afraid that something might happen to me, but I didn't realize how it might happen.

253
00:19:32,412 --> 00:19:35,333
Mhm. And about those Russians.

254
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:40,201
Why didn't you feel more, yes, compassion for him?

255
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:45,201
Were you afraid to help him, were you? A little, yes. For what?

256
00:19:45,201 --> 00:19:50,201
Was it forbidden? Yes. Forbidden to do that? Yes, that was forbidden. Hm.

257
00:19:50,201 --> 00:19:55,201
And how did he react when you said, "No." He withdrew. He had no other choice.

258
00:19:55,201 --> 00:20:00,201
Hmm. And why did this event, why did it, uh, make such a deep impression on you?

259
00:20:00,201 --> 00:20:05,201
Because I realized that the situation itself, uh, made me react inhumanely. Hm.

260
00:20:05,201 --> 00:20:10,201
Is it your fault or is it the society you grew up in, uh.

261
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:15,201
Especially with this Nazi propaganda, is that to blame?

262
00:20:15,201 --> 00:20:20,201
I don't just want to blame others. It's always yourself as well.

263
00:20:20,201 --> 00:20:25,201
Of course they were the cause, but I mean, I could have reacted differently.

264
00:20:25,201 --> 00:20:25,591
Mmm.

265
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:30,591
Did your mother find it strange that you and your brother had to serve in the German Wehrmacht as so-called half-breeds?

266
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:35,591
Yes. Hm. And did you talk to your mother about it? I can't remember.

267
00:20:35,591 --> 00:20:38,901
What good would it have done? Mhm.

268
00:20:38,901 --> 00:20:43,901
It would have, it would have turned out the way it was supposed to.

269
00:20:43,901 --> 00:20:48,901
We would have had to report to the military, we would have gone. Mhm.

270
00:20:48,901 --> 00:20:53,901
And your mother, were you afraid of being deported? I think so, yes.

271
00:20:53,901 --> 00:20:57,698
She hoped that she would be spared that

272
00:20:57,698 --> 00:21:02,698
because my father was severely war-damaged from the First World War

273
00:21:02,698 --> 00:21:06,399
fifty percent, he was hard of hearing.

274
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:11,399
And it could be that, uh, that the reason was that nothing happened to her.

275
00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:16,170
Uh, I suspect that if that had gone on any longer

276
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:21,135
all the half-Jews might have been deported as well.

277
00:21:21,135 --> 00:21:25,712
She was lucky that nothing happened to her. Hm.

278
00:21:25,712 --> 00:21:30,712
From all your experiences back then, what have you learned for your life?

279
00:21:30,712 --> 00:21:35,712
Uh, to be tolerant even towards minorities, for example.

280
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:40,712
Whether it's the Turks today or someone else tomorrow.

281
00:21:40,712 --> 00:21:44,704
Uh, it's, uh, self-evident to me that, uh

282
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:49,378
no one is inferior to anyone else because of, uh

283
00:21:49,378 --> 00:21:54,378
their origin or religion or anything else. That's completely nonsensical.

284
00:21:54,378 --> 00:21:59,378
Uh-huh. Doctor, thank you. Sir, can you say your name? What is your name?

285
00:21:59,378 --> 00:22:04,378
For my documentation. Heinz Schindler. And where and when were you born?

286
00:22:04,378 --> 00:22:06,812
02.06.13. Mhm. And where?

287
00:22:06,812 --> 00:22:11,812
And when you were young, did you know that you were of Jewish descent?

288
00:22:11,812 --> 00:22:16,812
From the beginning, yes. Hm. Were you brought up in Jewish customs, or? No. Hm.

289
00:22:16,812 --> 00:22:21,812
Because my Jewish father left the Jewish community in Berlin out of political conviction.

290
00:22:21,812 --> 00:22:26,812
Did he give a reason for that? A what? Give a reason for it?

291
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:31,812
He was a convinced socialist and dissident, as they call it.

292
00:22:31,812 --> 00:22:36,096
Although he came from an orthodox household.

293
00:22:36,096 --> 00:22:41,096
And, uh, did he have trouble with his parents because he married a non-Jewish woman?

294
00:22:41,096 --> 00:22:46,096
Yes. Hm. Yes, very much so. Hm. But he didn't care. Hm. And on the other hand

295
00:22:46,096 --> 00:22:51,096
your mother's parents had difficulties because they- My mother had no, uh

296
00:22:51,096 --> 00:22:56,096
parents who had died very young. My mother grew up with so-called step-parents.

297
00:22:56,096 --> 00:22:59,017
There were no problems at all.

298
00:22:59,017 --> 00:23:04,017
What's more, my mother only met my father when she had long, uh, passed away.

299
00:23:04,017 --> 00:23:09,017
How old was my mother? Uhhh, about twenty-six years old.

300
00:23:09,017 --> 00:23:14,017
So, she was in charge of herself. She wasn't responsible to anyone. Hmmm.

301
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:19,017
So, how were you brought up in religion? Uhhh, as a dissident. Dissident, yes.

302
00:23:19,017 --> 00:23:22,912
Without any religious affiliation. Hmmm.

303
00:23:22,912 --> 00:23:27,912
The fact that it was different afterwards was a tactical technical move, nothing more.

304
00:23:27,912 --> 00:23:32,912
Hmmm. And did you have contact with your Jewish grandparents?

305
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:37,912
Yes, not grandparents, but grandmother. Hmmm. Uh, three aunts, two uncles. Hmmm.

306
00:23:37,912 --> 00:23:41,612
And did you go to the synagogue a lot?

307
00:23:41,612 --> 00:23:46,612
But yes, I even sang on the Jewish holidays of Shom Kippur and Rosh Ha-Shanah.

308
00:23:46,612 --> 00:23:50,020
In a liberal synagogue. Sure- Hmmm.

309
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:55,020
-had to be liberal, because the Orthodox didn't sing in the choir. Hmmm.

310
00:23:55,020 --> 00:24:00,020
And do you still remember your prayers or your songs? But yes. Oh.

311
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,454
Can you, uh, repeat that?

312
00:24:02,454 --> 00:24:07,454
Yes, let's start with Ma Tow or, uh, all, uh Asehle man schmecho.

313
00:24:07,454 --> 00:24:12,454
Anything like that. Do you do that these days? No. (laughs) So, yes.

314
00:24:12,454 --> 00:24:17,454
Can you describe your childhood, uh, to the students?

315
00:24:17,454 --> 00:24:21,057
It was a very normal childhood. Hmmm.

316
00:24:21,057 --> 00:24:26,057
Did you have any difficulties because of your- Not at all.

317
00:24:26,057 --> 00:24:31,057
That didn't exist in my time. Ha. So when the Nazis came to power - yes.

318
00:24:31,057 --> 00:24:36,057
-Did you talk to your parents about what we should do, maybe go abroad, or?

319
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:40,438
Not at all. That wasn't an issue at all. Hmm.

320
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:45,438
So, what did you think when Hitler came to power? Yes.

321
00:24:45,438 --> 00:24:50,438
(takes a deep breath) Uh, that was an inevitable fate. Hmm.

322
00:24:50,438 --> 00:24:55,438
Determined by many factors that have long since become common knowledge.

323
00:24:55,438 --> 00:24:58,651
Unemployment, the shaky democracy

324
00:24:58,651 --> 00:25:03,651
the right-wing circles from the old officers around Ludendorff, Hohenberg

325
00:25:03,651 --> 00:25:04,625
Stahlhelm.

326
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:09,625
That was one side that was constantly working against the Weimar Republic in-- And on the other side

327
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:14,625
of course, was communism, wasn't it? In 1925, for example, when Ebert died

328
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:19,625
a new Reich President had to be elected and the entire right-wing coalition

329
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:24,625
from the German Nationals at the top down to the Center, uh, put up Hindenburg.

330
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:29,396
And the Social Democrats had their own candidate.

331
00:25:29,396 --> 00:25:34,396
And the worst thing in my view was that the Communists also had their own candidate.

332
00:25:34,396 --> 00:25:37,317
So that means, together- Hmhm.

333
00:25:37,317 --> 00:25:42,317
-Social Democrats and Communists could have easily got their candidate through.

334
00:25:42,317 --> 00:25:47,317
But the fact that the Communists always insisted on representing their own, uh

335
00:25:47,317 --> 00:25:52,317
interests, that was completely wrong and apolitical.

336
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:55,920
In other words, from my point of view

337
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:00,920
the Communists were largely to blame for the National Socialists coming to power in 1933.

338
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:05,920
The fact that they had to pay for it all afterwards is another matter. Hmhm.

339
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:10,920
Yes, and that's how I grew up and when I wasn't quite so affected by it, I became seriously ill.

340
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,920
In other words, during the transition period I was in hospital with severe kidney poisoning.

341
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:20,920
And when that had subsided, as I was a musician, I went back to making music on a freelance basis.

342
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:25,920
Then came the first big blow: I was no longer allowed to pursue my profession as a musician because the so-called Reichsmusikkammer didn't accept me and my brother.

343
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,920
Do you know the encyclopedia Jews in Music? Aha, you see. But I have it.

344
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:35,920
That means I'm in an encyclopaedia during my lifetime.

345
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,451
Although not very edifying

346
00:26:38,451 --> 00:26:43,451
because this encyclopaedia was only intended for the official use of the NSDAP.

347
00:26:43,451 --> 00:26:48,125
In other words, all the so-called administrators

348
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:53,125
everyone who had anything to do with music in the so-called Third Reich

349
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:56,728
had this encyclopaedia on their desk.

350
00:26:56,728 --> 00:27:01,304
And it listed all those who were either Jewish.

351
00:27:01,304 --> 00:27:06,304
Jewish by blood, not the quarter-Jews, they weren't in there.

352
00:27:06,304 --> 00:27:11,304
But composers like Mendelssohn Bartholdy, like Gustav Mahler

353
00:27:11,304 --> 00:27:16,304
conductors like Blech, Bruno Walter Klemperer were all in there.

354
00:27:16,304 --> 00:27:20,199
And I have the honor of being in it too.

355
00:27:20,199 --> 00:27:25,199
I'm proud of that, even though it was directed against me at the time.

356
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:30,199
So that means that nobody hired me because I was in that dictionary. Yes.

357
00:27:30,199 --> 00:27:34,678
Shall we show him? What's your brother's name?

358
00:27:34,678 --> 00:27:39,678
My brother is deceased, but he's also in the dictionary. Hm. What's his name?

359
00:27:39,678 --> 00:27:40,943
Erwin. Erwin.

360
00:27:40,943 --> 00:27:45,943
That's the one who was in that squad with Wolfgang Behrend, Günter Lebrandt

361
00:27:45,943 --> 00:27:50,943
Werner Gransch, Bosshardt, who weren't in the Wehrmacht

362
00:27:50,943 --> 00:27:55,943
they were in the so-called UT, weren't they? That was a forced labor formation.

363
00:27:55,943 --> 00:28:00,943
And my brother was there. I myself served as the lowest rank in the Wehrmacht.

364
00:28:00,943 --> 00:28:05,943
As you can see, that's the success. You can easily get this book in anyone.

365
00:28:05,943 --> 00:28:10,943
What did you say? Which archive are you with? The Federal Archives. Of course.

366
00:28:10,943 --> 00:28:15,943
Do you want to make a note of that? Yes, afterward. Oh, I told you.

367
00:28:15,943 --> 00:28:20,943
Give me that, child. Here you are. This is the lexicon of Jews in music.

368
00:28:20,943 --> 00:28:24,254
Von Stengel crossed out the court.

369
00:28:24,254 --> 00:28:29,254
Those were the two rascals who compiled it with a list of titles of Jewish works on behalf of the Reichsleitung der NSDAP on the basis of official party-approved documents

370
00:28:29,254 --> 00:28:30,520
edited by Dr.

371
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:35,520
Theo Stengel, consultant at the Reichsmusikkammer in conjunction with Dr. habil.

372
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,786
Herbert Gerig

373
00:28:36,786 --> 00:28:41,786
Head of the Main Office for Music at the Führer's Commissioner for the Supervision of the NSDAP's entire intellectual and ideological training and education.

374
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:46,786
The worst thing is that these two thugs. After 1945.

375
00:28:46,786 --> 00:28:51,786
in the judicial authority of Lower Saxony. One was a public prosecutor.

376
00:28:51,786 --> 00:28:55,291
I don't know what the other one did.

377
00:28:55,291 --> 00:29:00,291
I once thought I'd go there and murder them or something.

378
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:03,601
But it wouldn't have been any use.

379
00:29:03,601 --> 00:29:08,601
So they still had well-paid jobs in the so-called republic after 1945.

380
00:29:08,601 --> 00:29:13,601
And now, of course, I'm drawing a parallel with today's Federal Republic.

381
00:29:13,601 --> 00:29:17,399
Politically, it stinks everywhere here.

382
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:22,399
You have the recent events in the Bundeswehr, the right-wing extremists, the anti-Semites.

383
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,780
That's how it started in the Weimar Republic.

384
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:31,780
And today we're at that point again. So. What else do you want to know?

385
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:36,780
So, in 1935, please? In 1935, when the Nuremberg Laws came out. But before that.

386
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:41,780
I was already at these documents before that. Before 35. That's the nastiness.

387
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:46,780
But when you were suddenly a so-called half-Jew, in 35, with these new laws

388
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:51,780
what did you think about it? What was I supposed to think?

389
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:55,578
I was glad that they didn't pick me up.

390
00:29:55,578 --> 00:30:00,578
And I earned my living doing very menial work in a factory as an unskilled laborer and was glad that they didn't get me.

391
00:30:00,578 --> 00:30:05,578
That worked. You said you were with the Schmechel brother. The...

392
00:30:05,578 --> 00:30:08,012
They were three brothers.

393
00:30:08,012 --> 00:30:13,012
And I worked in a factory until I was nineteen thirty-nine

394
00:30:13,012 --> 00:30:18,012
until the beginning of the Second World War, which produced so-called pills

395
00:30:18,012 --> 00:30:23,012
machines, I don't know, for the whole, uh, what do you call it, Mona?

396
00:30:23,012 --> 00:30:28,012
A pharmacy or- Yes, yes. Well, they make pills, medicines.

397
00:30:28,012 --> 00:30:31,809
I was employed there as a small worker.

398
00:30:31,809 --> 00:30:36,809
And the moment the war started, the authorized signatory

399
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:41,809
who was actually quite sympathetic to me, called me in and said: "Mr.

400
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:46,809
Schindler, we have to part company with you, because we're a military company from now on.

401
00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:51,809
We all have to be sworn in and you can't be sworn in." Yes. Then, uh

402
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:56,809
since there was a shortage of work because so many people had been drafted

403
00:30:56,809 --> 00:31:00,899
I ended up in a machine factory in Moabit.

404
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:05,899
Since I was already familiar with accounting, payroll accounting and, and, and

405
00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:09,307
and, worker cards and, and, and, um

406
00:31:09,307 --> 00:31:14,307
I got a position there as a post-calculator, as it was called.

407
00:31:14,307 --> 00:31:19,307
And there was one of my, how should I put it, colleagues

408
00:31:19,307 --> 00:31:24,307
he was quite young at the time, standing at the lathe. That was Horst Schmechel.

409
00:31:24,307 --> 00:31:29,307
I've known him since 1940, Horst. He lives in Dortmund. Did you ever visit him?

410
00:31:29,307 --> 00:31:34,307
Mhm. Yes. You were in Dortmund then too? Yes, he was.

411
00:31:34,307 --> 00:31:39,307
Didn't he tell you about me? No. A little bit. Please?

412
00:31:39,307 --> 00:31:44,307
He said a bit-- He said that, uh, you met someone else back then. Yes.

413
00:31:44,307 --> 00:31:49,307
But I was much older than him. He was still an apprentice back then.

414
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:54,307
(bell ringing) In 1936, I was officially sent to the, uh, Wehrmacht examination

415
00:31:54,307 --> 00:31:59,307
that is, a soldier's examination. I don't know what that shit is called.

416
00:31:59,307 --> 00:32:02,033
Mustering. Mustering, right.

417
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:07,033
Yes, these things, uh, don't let me articulate properly

418
00:32:07,033 --> 00:32:12,033
because then I always get the coffee up when I think about this crap. Mmm.

419
00:32:12,033 --> 00:32:17,033
So I was drafted in '36 and my kidney disease from 1934 still had an effect.

420
00:32:17,033 --> 00:32:21,317
You know, you have to urinate and, and, and.

421
00:32:21,317 --> 00:32:26,317
And so I still had a very high protein content and was written up as unfit.

422
00:32:26,317 --> 00:32:30,017
Now I have to proceed in the same way.

423
00:32:30,017 --> 00:32:34,886
Uh, nineteen forty-one, end of nineteen forty-one.

424
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:39,886
I lived in Berlin in Wedding and now comes something that's not so obvious or anything.

425
00:32:39,886 --> 00:32:44,886
When I say, "Yes, why?" A Nazi, a teacher, lived above me and he had a Polish maid.

426
00:32:44,886 --> 00:32:49,886
And he took this oaf of a girl and my mother suffered because of it.

427
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:54,886
And I listened to it for quite a while and at least I didn't want my mother to...

428
00:32:54,886 --> 00:32:59,559
I don't know anymore. I'm a bit choleric, maybe.

429
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:04,559
I went up there, banged on the door and made a mess of them, as we say in Germany.

430
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:09,559
So I shouted, yes, and also insulted them, telling them to leave my mother alone.

431
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:12,967
She complained to her employer, Mr.

432
00:33:12,967 --> 00:33:17,967
Flöter, the teacher, and he reported me to the police.

433
00:33:17,967 --> 00:33:22,967
He was an old Nazi and you know these organizations, local groups and so on.

434
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:27,967
And I was summoned there for questioning. That was very interesting.

435
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:32,967
Well, when you live in an area for decades, especially in a working-class area

436
00:33:32,967 --> 00:33:37,967
which was Wedding, you were known. That's quite clear.

437
00:33:37,967 --> 00:33:42,252
Everyone knew everyone in the nearby houses.

438
00:33:42,252 --> 00:33:47,252
And this conversation between the so-called local group leader and Mr.

439
00:33:47,252 --> 00:33:52,252
Flöter on the one hand and me sitting on the other as a defendant.

440
00:33:52,252 --> 00:33:55,854
No, I wasn't sitting, I had to stand.

441
00:33:55,854 --> 00:34:00,854
And then, uh, the local group leader shouted at me what I was thinking

442
00:34:00,854 --> 00:34:05,236
I was born in Berlin in the third generation.

443
00:34:05,236 --> 00:34:10,236
I was only, uh, a guest in Germany, how could I come to insult this Polish servant girl.

444
00:34:10,236 --> 00:34:15,236
And he will make sure that I get into the concentration camp.

445
00:34:15,236 --> 00:34:20,236
And then I heard, I'll never forget: "Comrade, Party comrade Flöter

446
00:34:20,236 --> 00:34:25,236
leave me alone with the man now." I thought I might get beaten or whatever.

447
00:34:25,236 --> 00:34:30,236
And this teacher was outside and I just said that everyone there knew everyone in the

448
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:35,236
yes, in the nearest houses. That means I grew up there, mhm.

449
00:34:35,236 --> 00:34:40,236
And then the local group leader changed his tone and said to me: "Heinz

450
00:34:40,236 --> 00:34:43,644
how can you do something like that?

451
00:34:43,644 --> 00:34:48,644
I've known you for so long, you know me." Local group leader of the NSDAP.

452
00:34:48,644 --> 00:34:53,644
Well, I have to-- "He insists that you go to a concentration camp." "Yes

453
00:34:53,644 --> 00:34:58,123
" I say, "I can, but I can only try one thing.

454
00:34:58,123 --> 00:35:03,123
Uh, write to the Führer's office and tell them that you've never been noticed

455
00:35:03,123 --> 00:35:08,123
that you..." And, and, and, "I'll write a good report for you.

456
00:35:08,123 --> 00:35:13,123
Maybe you can be accepted into the Wehrmacht. But not into the regular Wehrmacht

457
00:35:13,123 --> 00:35:18,123
but into a probationary battalion." So I was first examined again on the basis of this letter and was healthy.

458
00:35:18,123 --> 00:35:23,123
My kidney disease was over. A few months later, in April, I got my call-up.

459
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:28,123
Uh, with a facsimile letter signed by the so-called Führer, Adolf Hitler, that criminal.

460
00:35:28,123 --> 00:35:30,946
He never signed it, of course

461
00:35:30,946 --> 00:35:35,946
because it said that the conscription of Jewish half-breeds of the first or second degree into the Wehrmacht could only be carried out with the personal exception of the Führer.

462
00:35:35,946 --> 00:35:40,946
All nonsense. That was signed by the, the, the, uh, what's his name?

463
00:35:40,946 --> 00:35:45,946
That Bormann signed it, the Hitler-Bemuh-- nonsense.

464
00:35:45,946 --> 00:35:50,946
So I was drafted and five days later, my mother told me

465
00:35:50,946 --> 00:35:55,946
two SS men stood outside our apartment door and wanted to pick me up to go to the concentration camp.

466
00:35:55,946 --> 00:36:00,815
And I had now escaped from the clutches of the SS.

467
00:36:00,815 --> 00:36:05,391
I couldn't-- they couldn't lick my ass anymore.

468
00:36:05,391 --> 00:36:10,391
And then I had a really interesting time in a probation battalion.

469
00:36:10,391 --> 00:36:15,391
But if I told you all that, I'd be sitting here until tomorrow morning.

470
00:36:15,391 --> 00:36:19,578
There you go. No, no, that's no use at all.

471
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:24,578
Uh, my wingman, he was one-eighty tall in our little bunch, he was a, uh

472
00:36:24,578 --> 00:36:29,578
former lieutenant general from the First World War, demoted.

473
00:36:29,578 --> 00:36:31,817
Had the Pour le mérite.

474
00:36:31,817 --> 00:36:36,817
Then they were all, uh, accounting sergeants, um, and whatever the guys were called.

475
00:36:36,817 --> 00:36:41,817
And they had embezzled whole wagons of chocolate and alcohol, they were demoted.

476
00:36:41,817 --> 00:36:44,252
One, uh, first lieutenant

477
00:36:44,252 --> 00:36:49,252
who was in the intelligence-- some intelligence department

478
00:36:49,252 --> 00:36:54,252
was demoted because he had committed a serious offense against a twelve-year-old Russian girl.

479
00:36:54,252 --> 00:36:56,881
So that happened too. Good.

480
00:36:56,881 --> 00:37:01,881
Uh, I was sent to the Demyansk cauldron, that was on Lake Ilmen

481
00:37:01,881 --> 00:37:06,881
in the northern part of Russia, after my basic training and whatnot.

482
00:37:06,881 --> 00:37:11,881
Well, and that's where my arm blew up in my face on February 19, '43. (I was.

483
00:37:11,881 --> 00:37:16,881
I had-- oh, by the way, interesting: on the Wehrmacht blouse, people always get it all mixed up.

484
00:37:16,881 --> 00:37:21,554
Probationary battalion and punishment battalion.

485
00:37:21,554 --> 00:37:26,554
The people from the punishment battalion had no insignia at all and nothing.

486
00:37:26,554 --> 00:37:31,554
We in the probation battalion even wore this swastika, this one, on our Wehrmacht uniform.

487
00:37:31,554 --> 00:37:36,554
But as I said, I was just a rifleman's ass, as they called it in Germany.

488
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:40,352
And on February 19, '43, I was wounded.

489
00:37:40,352 --> 00:37:45,352
Well, then the usual route through the many military hospitals and, and, and.

490
00:37:45,352 --> 00:37:48,467
I came to Berlin in October '43.

491
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:53,467
Now I told you that I, my brother too, sang in a liberal synagogue during the holidays.

492
00:37:53,467 --> 00:37:58,141
I had or have a very good voice, my brother too.

493
00:37:58,141 --> 00:38:03,141
And of course I was very interesting as a tenor for various professional choirs in 1943.

494
00:38:03,141 --> 00:38:08,141
And so there was a radio choir in Berlin and the conductor, a salami

495
00:38:08,141 --> 00:38:13,141
was delighted that he now had a tenor again because most of them had been drafted.

496
00:38:13,141 --> 00:38:16,646
The joy lasted less than four weeks.

497
00:38:16,646 --> 00:38:21,646
Then I had to go down to the so-called personnel department.

498
00:38:21,646 --> 00:38:26,646
And there sat a Sturmbannführer. Didn't you remember his name?

499
00:38:26,646 --> 00:38:31,646
Sturmbannführer of the SS. "Tell me, what are you doing here?" Söhnchen.

500
00:38:31,646 --> 00:38:35,541
Me: "Yes, son, I'm in the choir with Mr.

501
00:38:35,541 --> 00:38:40,541
Lamy." Literally now: "Even if you are severely war-damaged

502
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:45,541
you are and will remain a Jewish half-breed and now you are coming to the house." Hmmm

503
00:38:45,541 --> 00:38:50,541
hmmm. Then I swore to myself: "When these thugs are gone

504
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:55,541
I'll be the first one (tapping my fingers on the table) to go into the Funkhaus." That's how it was.

505
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:58,560
And if you want to know from me

506
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,560
I've already said it before: I'm very depressed about the development in the Federal Republic.

507
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,994
Just think of Mr. Globke.

508
00:39:05,994 --> 00:39:10,994
But most of my so-called comrades no longer concern themselves with these things.

509
00:39:10,994 --> 00:39:15,994
They don't even know anything about it anymore. Think of Gehlen.

510
00:39:15,994 --> 00:39:20,994
Are they all terms? Yes, these thugs? And who sponsored them? Mr. Adenauer.

511
00:39:20,994 --> 00:39:25,994
Well, let's leave it. I'm just getting upset, it's no use.

512
00:39:25,994 --> 00:39:30,994
So now you know a lot about me. Sören zu Militär was in your company. Yes.

513
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:35,862
Were there any other men who were Jewish-- No, no.

514
00:39:35,862 --> 00:39:40,862
They were all just demoted, uh, officers. And did you see your permit?

515
00:39:40,862 --> 00:39:45,862
The authorization on you? That the Führer signed? Mhm.

516
00:39:45,862 --> 00:39:50,633
Yes, yes, I had it, but I no longer have it. Hmm.

517
00:39:50,633 --> 00:39:55,633
What did you think about it at the time? What should I have thought?

518
00:39:55,633 --> 00:40:00,633
I thought: "Thank God I'm not going to a concentration camp." Mhm. That's clear.

519
00:40:00,633 --> 00:40:05,633
And what was the camaraderie like? Bad. Very bad. Hmm. Very bad.

520
00:40:05,633 --> 00:40:08,457
I can tell you two incidents.

521
00:40:08,457 --> 00:40:13,457
Im-- I was in the front line in the trenches in a positional war, so not in combat, uh...

522
00:40:13,457 --> 00:40:18,033
Well, we were in a trench war, in the trenches.

523
00:40:18,033 --> 00:40:23,033
And, uh, between us and the Russian front line was maybe na-- at most, but at most a kilometer.

524
00:40:23,033 --> 00:40:26,441
There were trenches over there too.

525
00:40:26,441 --> 00:40:31,018
And between the trenches were Spanish horsemen.

526
00:40:31,018 --> 00:40:36,018
You know what a Spanish horseman is? You know that. Uh-huh. Mm.

527
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:39,620
And, uh, there was a first lieutenant

528
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:44,620
that's the one who went on the Russian twelve-year-old girl ride

529
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:48,807
so I can tell him, he stared her dead. Yes.

530
00:40:48,807 --> 00:40:53,807
And it was a miracle that he was brought to justice at all

531
00:40:53,807 --> 00:40:58,807
because he was decorated with the German Cross in gold and everything.

532
00:40:58,807 --> 00:41:01,728
But as I said, he was demoted.

533
00:41:01,728 --> 00:41:06,728
And we had a very nice (scoffs)-what do you mean nice? Nonsense.

534
00:41:06,728 --> 00:41:11,728
Russian propaganda with loudspeakers. It was like that everywhere.

535
00:41:11,728 --> 00:41:16,728
They knew very well that we were a Berlin, uh, company, uh, of, uh-- you see

536
00:41:16,728 --> 00:41:21,207
I'm at a loss for words-- of demoted men. Mhm.

537
00:41:21,207 --> 00:41:26,207
And said: "We know you're from Berlin. Come over here to us." Literally.

538
00:41:26,207 --> 00:41:31,207
"There are horny women and white beds waiting for you here." I've never forgotten that.

539
00:41:31,207 --> 00:41:36,207
"There are horny women and white beds waiting for you here." My ass.

540
00:41:36,207 --> 00:41:41,207
Uh, so quite a few people did try to, uh, cross over, but not from my company.

541
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:46,207
There were only two cases, I'll tell you about them briefly.

542
00:41:46,207 --> 00:41:51,207
For me it was out of the question, because if I had tried to cross over

543
00:41:51,207 --> 00:41:56,207
my mother and my brother would have been arrested immediately.

544
00:41:56,207 --> 00:42:00,686
My brother was still living in Berlin. He was.

545
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:04,483
So that was out of the question for me.

546
00:42:04,483 --> 00:42:09,483
(clears throat) There was a first lieutenant, he was a first lieutenant in an intelligence unit.

547
00:42:09,483 --> 00:42:12,599
And, uh, he disappeared one day.

548
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:17,599
Nobody, uh, gave it any thought, because I told you, the so-called comradeship was shit.

549
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:22,599
It didn't exist at all. Everyone lived for themselves and...

550
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:27,599
I can prove that later with an example. So one day this lieutenant left.

551
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:32,599
This highly decorated first lieutenant, who had been demoted, suddenly disappeared.

552
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:35,618
He reappeared three days later.

553
00:42:35,618 --> 00:42:40,618
He had somehow overcome the Spanish horsemen, got to the Russian line and

554
00:42:40,618 --> 00:42:45,618
as a naturally trained intelligence officer, tapped the telephone line to the

555
00:42:45,618 --> 00:42:49,512
er, battalion, to the Russian battalion.

556
00:42:49,512 --> 00:42:54,512
So he had prepared himself for this and after three days he arrives with us and has the line in tow so that our offices can listen in on all the communications with the Russians.

557
00:42:54,512 --> 00:42:59,512
(clears throat) The man was immediately recalled to his old rank.

558
00:42:59,512 --> 00:43:04,283
So he immediately became a first lieutenant again

559
00:43:04,283 --> 00:43:09,283
was allowed to wear all his medals and then we lost sight of him.

560
00:43:09,283 --> 00:43:13,957
That didn't let a non-commissioned officer rest.

561
00:43:13,957 --> 00:43:18,957
He also wanted to become a non-commissioned officer again or whatever.

562
00:43:18,957 --> 00:43:23,957
And he made an attempt to do something over there. Probably didn't get very far.

563
00:43:23,957 --> 00:43:28,436
I don't even know if he got past the wire ban.

564
00:43:28,436 --> 00:43:32,915
And then we heard him screaming day and night.

565
00:43:32,915 --> 00:43:37,915
He'd been shot by the Russians and must have been-- And we gathered that from his...

566
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:42,915
He screamed for a long time. He must have been shot in the stomach.

567
00:43:42,915 --> 00:43:47,915
And the camaraderie among us was so great that no one even cared about the guy.

568
00:43:47,915 --> 00:43:52,915
We thought: "Oh well, if he does that, it's his own business." Then he bled to death.

569
00:43:52,915 --> 00:43:57,915
We didn't give a damn. Yes? That's how hard it was there.

570
00:43:57,915 --> 00:44:02,915
And that's how good the camaraderie was. And when you became a soldier. Me?

571
00:44:02,915 --> 00:44:05,836
What did you think about that?

572
00:44:05,836 --> 00:44:10,836
Did you think: "That's funny that I was a-" I told you earlier

573
00:44:10,836 --> 00:44:15,836
I told you earlier, I was glad I didn't have to go to a concentration camp.

574
00:44:15,836 --> 00:44:19,536
Maybe I'm that cowardly, I don't know.

575
00:44:19,536 --> 00:44:24,536
Or should I have gone to the concentration camp with my head held high?

576
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:27,555
Is that a question for me? Yes.

577
00:44:27,555 --> 00:44:32,555
Yes, I, yes, the idea, you know, (chuckle) I don't believe that.

578
00:44:32,555 --> 00:44:37,555
But with your mother, did you talk to your mother and brother about what you were doing - when?

579
00:44:37,555 --> 00:44:42,555
Before they got that authorization, what you should do to protect the family.

580
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:47,326
I always did what I wanted. I never asked anyone.

581
00:44:47,326 --> 00:44:52,326
And I had such a good relationship with my mother, who was naturally afraid for me.

582
00:44:52,326 --> 00:44:57,326
Because of the SS. And where was your Jewish father during this time?

583
00:44:57,326 --> 00:45:02,326
He was buried in 1934, no, '36. 1936 in Bahia in the English cemetery.

584
00:45:02,326 --> 00:45:07,326
He had an assignment, because he spoke perfect Spanish and Portuguese

585
00:45:07,326 --> 00:45:12,326
to create a Jewish refuge for Jewish emigrants, for Jewish refugees

586
00:45:12,326 --> 00:45:17,326
in a jungle area. Under the most difficult conditions.

587
00:45:17,326 --> 00:45:22,326
My father only lived there for a few days and, er, was probably bitten by an insect.

588
00:45:22,326 --> 00:45:27,326
He had to be taken to Bahia by motorboat on some river.

589
00:45:27,326 --> 00:45:32,326
He was already dead by then and was buried there in the English cemetery.

590
00:45:32,326 --> 00:45:37,326
A Polish fellow believer accompanied my father on the motorboat and you know that it is a duty of honor for a Jewish person to help a dead fellow believer

591
00:45:37,326 --> 00:45:42,326
to wash him, to read him the prayers for the dead and to say them.

592
00:45:42,326 --> 00:45:47,326
Even though my father was a so-called dissident. There's no such thing.

593
00:45:47,326 --> 00:45:52,326
A Jew remains a Jew. And he was always happy when he heard us singing. Sure.

594
00:45:52,326 --> 00:45:56,707
Asselmann Schimero or Matau or and, and, and.

595
00:45:56,707 --> 00:46:01,707
Yes, and now you know all about me. Do you feel Jewish yourself? Uh, no.

596
00:46:01,707 --> 00:46:05,310
I don't have the upbringing for that.

597
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:10,310
I, it was like this, my brother is three years older and was born before marriage.

598
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:15,310
And then my Jewish father married my Protestant mother.

599
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:18,328
And then I was born in wedlock.

600
00:46:18,328 --> 00:46:23,328
And then my father's orthodox Jewish mother tried to have my grandson circumcised.

601
00:46:23,328 --> 00:46:27,905
And my mother fought tooth and nail against it.

602
00:46:27,905 --> 00:46:31,994
And then, of course, there was the divide.

603
00:46:31,994 --> 00:46:36,994
My grandmother never forgave my mother for that. They're Texans.

604
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:41,994
My orthodox Jewish grandmother was born in an Indian tent in the USA.

605
00:46:41,994 --> 00:46:46,376
My grandfather came from Galicia or whatever.

606
00:46:46,376 --> 00:46:51,376
Emigrated to America because of the pogroms, got himself a little old horse, a, what do you call it?

607
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:56,376
Uh. Uh. A wagon like that. Yes, a covered wagon. Yes, a covered wagon. Yes. Mhm.

608
00:46:56,376 --> 00:47:01,376
Packed the covered wagon full of pots, with, uh, anything that might be knives

609
00:47:01,376 --> 00:47:06,376
forks, uh, something that was interesting for Indians back then.

610
00:47:06,376 --> 00:47:11,376
And, uh, on the Indian reservation, my great-grandmother went into labor.

611
00:47:11,376 --> 00:47:14,589
And they brought her into a tent.

612
00:47:14,589 --> 00:47:19,589
And the Indian women were so great at that sort of thing, the indigenous people.

613
00:47:19,589 --> 00:47:24,589
A birth was a small thing. And they helped my grandmother, er, into life.

614
00:47:24,589 --> 00:47:29,589
And my grandmother had, that's why I'm telling you this, of course she was a US citizen.

615
00:47:29,589 --> 00:47:31,926
She was born in the USA.

616
00:47:31,926 --> 00:47:36,926
And in that respect she was untouchable for the Nazis in Berlin and had the flag of the USA on her front door and stamped underneath: uh

617
00:47:36,926 --> 00:47:40,626
extraterritorial territory of the USA.

618
00:47:40,626 --> 00:47:45,626
That meant that the SS or SA were not allowed to enter the apartment.

619
00:47:45,626 --> 00:47:50,202
My grandmother died, I think at nineteen forty.

620
00:47:50,202 --> 00:47:55,202
The next day, the SS came and picked up my two aunts, who were still living with my mother.

621
00:47:55,202 --> 00:48:00,202
What were your aunts' names? Auntie, well Schindler, of course.

622
00:48:00,202 --> 00:48:05,202
She was unmarried. One aunt was sent to Riga, had to dig her own grave

623
00:48:05,202 --> 00:48:10,202
was shot and the other aunt was sent to Theresienstadt and died there.

624
00:48:10,202 --> 00:48:15,070
I deliberately say "perished". I don't say "died".

625
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:20,070
I am, if you like, full of hatred for the whole baggage.

626
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:25,070
Uh, and therefore also, I tell you, for the masses of the German people.

627
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:30,070
Because look at the pictures of them waving and cheering for the rag.

628
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:34,939
And my fear is that perhaps not to the same extent

629
00:48:34,939 --> 00:48:39,939
but that we have now reached a point again where anti-Semitism, racism, er

630
00:48:39,939 --> 00:48:42,568
is raising its cheeky head.

631
00:48:42,568 --> 00:48:47,568
And to an extent that we would never have believed in nineteen forty-five.

632
00:48:47,568 --> 00:48:52,568
It's appalling. And, uh, I deal with these things a lot.

633
00:48:52,568 --> 00:48:57,568
I'm thinking of the harrowing speech by Otto Wels. You're not familiar with it.

634
00:48:57,568 --> 00:49:02,568
Otto Wels was the leader of the Social Democrats' parliamentary group in the Reichstag

635
00:49:02,568 --> 00:49:07,568
where the Communists had already been kicked out after this engineered Reichstag fire by Göring.

636
00:49:07,568 --> 00:49:12,568
And then the Nazis submitted their so-called authorization motion

637
00:49:12,568 --> 00:49:17,568
which of course put all the power in the hands of these thugs.

638
00:49:17,568 --> 00:49:22,568
And everyone agreed. Are you familiar with Theodor Heuss?

639
00:49:22,568 --> 00:49:25,976
You see, Theodor Heuss also agreed.

640
00:49:25,976 --> 00:49:30,976
Back then as a member of parliament from the Center, uh, uh

641
00:49:30,976 --> 00:49:35,976
or as a Democrat from the Democratic Party. In any case, he voted with us.

642
00:49:35,976 --> 00:49:40,976
The only one who dared to stand up against it said in a, of course very moderate

643
00:49:40,976 --> 00:49:45,976
shocking speech that he and his parliamentary group could not agree to this Enabling Act

644
00:49:45,976 --> 00:49:50,357
this Enabling Act. That speech was appalling.

645
00:49:50,357 --> 00:49:55,357
I don't know what happened to Otto Wels. During your military service.

646
00:49:55,357 --> 00:50:00,357
After you were wounded - yes. Did you continue to serve in the German Wehrmacht?

647
00:50:00,357 --> 00:50:04,934
No. You were discharged? I was discharged, yes.

648
00:50:04,934 --> 00:50:09,934
And did you have a- I told you that. Then I sang in the choir.

649
00:50:09,934 --> 00:50:14,934
So I was discharged. But not in the Wehrmacht choir? No, in the radio choir.

650
00:50:14,934 --> 00:50:19,934
Berlin radio. And then this SS-Sturmbannführer kicked me out.

651
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:24,934
Did you get special permission because of your serious injury? No. (laughs) Why?

652
00:50:24,934 --> 00:50:27,465
I'm just telling you. Mhm.

653
00:50:27,465 --> 00:50:32,465
The Sturmbannführer said that even if I was severely wounded in the war

654
00:50:32,465 --> 00:50:37,465
even if you were severely, severely wounded in the war

655
00:50:37,465 --> 00:50:42,465
you would remain a Jewish person. Make sure you get out.

656
00:50:42,465 --> 00:50:47,465
But what did the Wehrmacht say? Nothing at all. What should they say?

657
00:50:47,465 --> 00:50:51,165
The Wehrmacht isn't interested at all.

658
00:50:51,165 --> 00:50:56,165
What kind of constitution do you have in mind under "Wehrmacht"?

659
00:50:56,165 --> 00:50:59,476
I didn't even exist for them. Mhm.

660
00:50:59,476 --> 00:51:04,476
Were you allowed to get medals in your company? Honors? Yes.

661
00:51:04,476 --> 00:51:09,476
I was automatically entitled to the silver medal for the wounded and I should have been promoted to private.

662
00:51:09,476 --> 00:51:14,476
Neither happened. The Wehrmacht gave you a reason why? Yes.

663
00:51:14,476 --> 00:51:19,476
It was swept under the table, swept under the carpet.

664
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:24,476
You can't blame me for being so clear here. No, please.

665
00:51:24,476 --> 00:51:29,476
It always makes my head spin when I think about it. Hm Zuavang is enough.

666
00:51:29,476 --> 00:51:34,476
How are you wounded? What happened? Why don't you talk here?

667
00:51:34,476 --> 00:51:39,476
Yes, but what happened in Russia? In Russia. It was a so-called Ratsch. Boom.

668
00:51:39,476 --> 00:51:41,910
I can't tell myself that.

669
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:46,910
It's an artillery shell that creaks and scatters at about that height.

670
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:51,910
And that's how my arm was shot through. And did your comrades help you?

671
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:56,910
Immediately, yes. Immediately. Oh, I wasn't with the company then.

672
00:51:56,910 --> 00:52:00,805
I was in a medical tent because of lice.

673
00:52:00,805 --> 00:52:04,992
Yes, yes, no, they helped me straight away.

674
00:52:04,992 --> 00:52:09,992
So, you joined a normal company later, with this medic. When later?

675
00:52:09,992 --> 00:52:14,992
After you were wounded? No, you said before I was wounded.

676
00:52:14,992 --> 00:52:19,992
That's when I was relieved of those horrible points on the rifle slope

677
00:52:19,992 --> 00:52:23,302
because I'd had a solitary attack.

678
00:52:23,302 --> 00:52:28,302
And in the army, did your comrades "feel like fighting? What did they have?

679
00:52:28,302 --> 00:52:33,302
A desire to fight. Oh, where from? So what did your comrades fight for?

680
00:52:33,302 --> 00:52:37,392
Well, their lives, because they wanted to.

681
00:52:37,392 --> 00:52:42,392
They weren't interested in what was over there or anywhere else.

682
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:45,994
They were just fighting for survival.

683
00:52:45,994 --> 00:52:50,994
And did the people under someone else talk about Hitler to the government?

684
00:52:50,994 --> 00:52:55,994
Oh dear, where? No. How were we supposed to talk politics over there?

685
00:52:55,994 --> 00:52:59,694
That would have been completely wrong.

686
00:52:59,694 --> 00:53:03,881
They had to see everyone else as a traitor.

687
00:53:03,881 --> 00:53:08,881
Did you have to swear an oath to Hitler in this preservation battalion? No.

688
00:53:08,881 --> 00:53:13,881
No, I wasn't sworn in. I don't think so. I can't say that for sure now.

689
00:53:13,881 --> 00:53:18,881
I don't think I was sworn in. I don't think so. Or I do.

690
00:53:18,881 --> 00:53:22,386
I know, I can't answer that for you.

691
00:53:22,386 --> 00:53:27,386
But if I had been asked, I would have done so. Of course I would have.

692
00:53:27,386 --> 00:53:32,386
I'm not a hero. Who did you actually hope, apart from the teacher, I think

693
00:53:32,386 --> 00:53:37,386
would get permission to stay in the German Wehrmacht?

694
00:53:37,386 --> 00:53:42,386
That local group leader, I told him just now. And his whole name?

695
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:47,386
Is he running around? I can't remember his name. No, I don't remember.

696
00:53:47,386 --> 00:53:52,386
But had other people written letters for you? Recommendation letters?

697
00:53:52,386 --> 00:53:57,386
No, no, no, nothing. Did you send photos there? What? Photos of you?

698
00:53:57,386 --> 00:54:02,386
No, not really. So how long did it take you to talk to this leader?

699
00:54:02,386 --> 00:54:07,386
To the group leader, yes. Until you got the authorization. How many weeks?

700
00:54:07,386 --> 00:54:12,386
Four months. Four months. What was your hope for the future during that time?

701
00:54:12,386 --> 00:54:17,386
Did you think that if I didn't have the opportunity, I would leave?

702
00:54:17,386 --> 00:54:22,060
Or did you think I could have a life in Germany?

703
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:25,955
I just have to survive through this war.

704
00:54:25,955 --> 00:54:30,955
If I hadn't lost this arm, I would have been the first to emigrate to Israel.

705
00:54:30,955 --> 00:54:35,955
I would have emigrated to Israel immediately. So why didn't you do that?

706
00:54:35,955 --> 00:54:40,955
What did I want? With one arm, what was I supposed to do?

707
00:54:40,955 --> 00:54:45,955
They only needed people who could work well in the kibbutz, who could get stuck in.

708
00:54:45,955 --> 00:54:50,955
That's not even a question. Do you feel a strong connection with Israel?

709
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:55,955
A first cousin was an airplane observer during the Six-Day War and one of my father's brothers

710
00:54:55,955 --> 00:55:00,955
my uncle, who had just come over in 1936, lived in the Dominican Republic

711
00:55:00,955 --> 00:55:05,823
then in Argentina and visited his nephew in Israel

712
00:55:05,823 --> 00:55:10,823
this military airplane observer. And he refused to talk to his uncle in German.

713
00:55:10,823 --> 00:55:15,823
I think that's all right. I think that's very right. Yes.

714
00:55:15,823 --> 00:55:19,913
Have you been to Israel? No, never before.

715
00:55:19,913 --> 00:55:24,913
I have no intention of going there either. That's not a contradiction at all.

716
00:55:24,913 --> 00:55:29,913
I'm also very, very critical of that. Everything that's happening in Israel.

717
00:55:29,913 --> 00:55:34,586
Have they not learned from the 6 million gassed?

718
00:55:34,586 --> 00:55:38,676
I couldn't have foreseen that at the time.

719
00:55:38,676 --> 00:55:43,676
In 1945, who would have believed that this Risches, this Netanyahu

720
00:55:43,676 --> 00:55:48,676
the murdered rabbi, would go off? It's going to blow up. I'm telling you. Why?

721
00:55:48,676 --> 00:55:53,676
After the war, you tried to live in another country, (crosstalk 00:00:09) except Germany.

722
00:55:53,676 --> 00:55:58,676
No, but not as a gravity-damaged person. You must realize that.

723
00:55:58,676 --> 00:56:03,676
Which country is interested in taking in a gravity-damaged person?

724
00:56:03,676 --> 00:56:08,676
Have you tried? But you didn't, you didn't, uh, like living in Germany.

725
00:56:08,676 --> 00:56:13,447
Did you after the Adenauer and Globka, uh, event.

726
00:56:13,447 --> 00:56:18,447
Did you think, maybe, I should go away from this country? No, no.

727
00:56:18,447 --> 00:56:23,447
It didn't go that far. I saw it with contempt. I saw it with disdain

728
00:56:23,447 --> 00:56:28,447
but nobody could take away my relationship to German culture

729
00:56:28,447 --> 00:56:31,271
or above all to German music.

730
00:56:31,271 --> 00:56:36,271
Nobody has taken that away from me and still hasn't.

731
00:56:36,271 --> 00:56:41,271
I still deal with my god, if you like. That is Gustav Mahler.

732
00:56:41,271 --> 00:56:46,271
I was already familiar with Gustav Mahler's symphonies when Gustav Mahler wasn't even a household name.

733
00:56:46,271 --> 00:56:49,971
Today you hear, ahem, that's en vogue.

734
00:56:49,971 --> 00:56:54,971
I had my first encounter with Gustav Mahler in 1930, with the, uh

735
00:56:54,971 --> 00:56:59,971
first symphony, with the Titan, when I was at college. Mmm.

736
00:56:59,971 --> 00:57:04,971
So, now you know so much about me. And what did you play? I was a clarinettist.

737
00:57:04,971 --> 00:57:09,971
And, uh, yes, I'd like to go back to your military service, when you were in Russia.

738
00:57:09,971 --> 00:57:13,768
Yes. What kind of weapons did you have?

739
00:57:13,768 --> 00:57:17,760
Wa-weapon course or position it's called.

740
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:22,760
(crosstalk 00:01:42) Was, were you a, were (crosstalk 00:01:43) you a little infantryman, right?

741
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:27,760
No, I, uh, had to be there in the, at the machine gun, uh-- So

742
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,760
but now I'll tell you another story about the comradeship and that's scythe.

743
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:37,760
I was on duty, uh, New Year's Eve 1942 at night, 1942 to '43.

744
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,363
And we were relieved every two hours.

745
00:57:41,363 --> 00:57:46,363
Machine gun duty, then we went back and had, we had, uh

746
00:57:46,363 --> 00:57:51,231
two big shell funnels with, uh, blankets laid out.

747
00:57:51,231 --> 00:57:54,542
That was our rest point and so on.

748
00:57:54,542 --> 00:57:59,542
And I had, uh, duty for two hours in the trench from, what we say today, twenty-two o'clock.

749
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:03,534
Back then we said ten o'clock to midnight

750
00:58:03,534 --> 00:58:08,534
so exactly until (claps hands) the new year or the end of the year.

751
00:58:08,534 --> 00:58:13,534
And I waited for my replacement. It didn't come. Didn't come.

752
00:58:13,534 --> 00:58:18,534
I stood there for four hours until two o'clock in the morning and then finally a replacement came.

753
00:58:18,534 --> 00:58:23,013
Then I went to the back, what was at the back.

754
00:58:23,013 --> 00:58:28,013
There was half a bottle of champagne and chocolate for everyone.

755
00:58:28,013 --> 00:58:33,013
They stole everything from me. That was the camaraderie.

756
00:58:33,013 --> 00:58:38,013
When did you find out about the Holocaust? When? Mhm.

757
00:58:38,013 --> 00:58:43,013
I told you what happened to my aunts. Yes. What happened to my uncles.

758
00:58:43,013 --> 00:58:48,013
My God, I have to go again... My father went to Brazil. Uh-huh.

759
00:58:48,013 --> 00:58:53,013
My uncles-- Well, do they still have enough? Yes? Nothing left.

760
00:58:53,013 --> 00:58:58,013
(crosstalk 00:04:03) Uh, one uncle went to Shanghai. Mhm.

761
00:58:58,013 --> 00:59:02,979
The other one went to the Dominican Republic first.

762
00:59:02,979 --> 00:59:07,979
My father, as I said, went to Brazil. Mhm. Of course I knew all that. Hm.

763
00:59:07,979 --> 00:59:08,952
Of course.

764
00:59:08,952 --> 00:59:13,952
Why didn't you tell me- (crosstalk 00:04:23) The horrific events in Galicia.

765
00:59:13,952 --> 00:59:18,952
What they did to the Jewish people. Did you see that as a soldier?

766
00:59:18,952 --> 00:59:23,952
No, when I was there-- I wasn't in a section, uh, but I was in the jungle, if you like.

767
00:59:23,952 --> 00:59:28,952
We were practically in the jungle, in the so-called Demyansk cauldron. Mhm.

768
00:59:28,952 --> 00:59:33,952
Uh, that's on Lake Ilmen. The starting point was Stalaja Russa.

769
00:59:33,952 --> 00:59:38,952
There were no Jews there, there weren't any. We were practically in the forest.

770
00:59:38,952 --> 00:59:39,342
Mhm.

771
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:44,342
Did any of your comrades know that she was a so-called (crosstalk 00:05:02) half-Jew?

772
00:59:44,342 --> 00:59:49,015
No, nope. I was also demoted. Nothing more. Mhm.

773
00:59:49,015 --> 00:59:54,015
Were you afraid that someone would find out about it?

774
00:59:54,015 --> 00:59:59,015
Oh, they wouldn't have been interested. Hmm. Really-really?

775
00:59:59,015 --> 01:00:04,015
Did, did you, when you, uh... Did you have a vacation? A what?

776
01:00:04,015 --> 01:00:09,015
When you were in the German army. Did you have a, a leave? Were you on leave?

777
01:00:09,015 --> 01:00:14,015
Yes. Never? No. Not one day while I was a soldier. Yes.

778
01:00:14,015 --> 01:00:18,787
I was on leave after every military hospital. Hm.

779
01:00:18,787 --> 01:00:23,787
And do you have other people in your family that you lost

780
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:28,787
apart from these two aunts in the Holocaust? From the Jewish side? Mhm. No.

781
01:00:28,787 --> 01:00:33,787
So it was just the two aunts who stupidly stayed in Germany because they thought they were protected by their mother's

782
01:00:33,787 --> 01:00:38,787
uh, US citizenship. Mhm. Yes, that ended the day my grandmother closed her eyes.

783
01:00:38,787 --> 01:00:43,787
The next day, the SS came and picked up my two aunts.

784
01:00:43,787 --> 01:00:48,787
The other siblings all went and came abroad, all of them.

785
01:00:48,787 --> 01:00:53,787
And what do you think would have happened if Germany had won the war?

786
01:00:53,787 --> 01:00:58,752
What would have happened to you? We all don't know.

787
01:00:58,752 --> 01:01:01,868
We can only theorize about that.

788
01:01:01,868 --> 01:01:06,868
But we probably would have had to, uh, get off the sidewalk and, uh

789
01:01:06,868 --> 01:01:11,868
maybe we would have been sent to labor camps or whatever. Hm.

790
01:01:11,868 --> 01:01:16,868
And in Russia, did you see the Russians? Of course I did. (laughs) Hm.

791
01:01:16,868 --> 01:01:21,868
Was it difficult, uh, to shoot at other people? Oh, like where. Oh.

792
01:01:21,868 --> 01:01:26,868
We didn't, we didn't do it at all. I didn't fire a single shot in the whole war.

793
01:01:26,868 --> 01:01:31,868
But you were a machine gunner, yes? Yes. I didn't need to be.

794
01:01:31,868 --> 01:01:36,868
So, how did you - that, I would only have set it in motion if they had launched an assault.

795
01:01:36,868 --> 01:01:41,868
But they were just as happy in the trenches as we were. Hm.

796
01:01:41,868 --> 01:01:46,868
And what was your worst memory as a soldier in Russia? Pff. Worst memory? Mhm.

797
01:01:46,868 --> 01:01:51,868
Jo. That we couldn't clear out. Hm. You realize I'm getting ironic now.

798
01:01:51,868 --> 01:01:56,868
That's obvious. And you know what clearing is. There you go.

799
01:01:56,868 --> 01:02:01,868
And from all your experiences, what have you learned for your life?

800
01:02:01,868 --> 01:02:05,179
From back then? I have to tell you

801
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:10,179
I told you earlier: I was already very independent as a boy and I didn't need to learn more.

802
01:02:10,179 --> 01:02:12,418
I just observed it all.

803
01:02:12,418 --> 01:02:17,418
I saw myself like an outsider and I still see myself today.

804
01:02:17,418 --> 01:02:22,418
I am happy that I have two wives - my first wife died - that I have this angel here.

805
01:02:22,418 --> 01:02:25,144
But we both limit ourselves.

806
01:02:25,144 --> 01:02:30,144
We live very secluded lives and I hope for a very, very long time. And, uh

807
01:02:30,144 --> 01:02:35,144
but you've probably gathered from a lot of this that I'm still involved in, uh

808
01:02:35,144 --> 01:02:39,526
politics, in the events of the day, but again

809
01:02:39,526 --> 01:02:43,908
just like an outsider watching a movie go by.

810
01:02:43,908 --> 01:02:47,900
Of course I take a stand for myself. Mmm.

811
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:52,900
And you and I have always agreed on everything, including politics.

812
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:57,900
We don't need anyone. We watch it, take a stand. Off.

813
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:02,900
I don't know if you can see what's there. Do you know that? Say it again?

814
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:07,900
The song you said on Yom Kippur. That was too long ago. Yes. So...

815
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:12,900
But can you, uh, say that, uh, prayer for, uh, again, what you sang a little bit?

816
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:17,900
That was nice. Well, at the beginning? Mhm. (sings) Lehu adanoj elohenu.

817
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:20,821
(sings) Jischnah-- uh, uh, uh.

818
01:03:20,821 --> 01:03:25,821
Jischnaseh, lehu alehu, jischnas, jischnah, chis, ah, they're all gone.

819
01:03:25,821 --> 01:03:30,821
(sings) Lehu adanaj elohim. That's how we started the New Year, I think.

820
01:03:30,821 --> 01:03:35,821
That was the beginning of- Rosh Hashana? Of the N-- Yes, Rosh Hashana.

821
01:03:35,821 --> 01:03:40,821
(sings) Lehu adanaj elohenu. But that's all I know about it now. And the Shma?

822
01:03:40,821 --> 01:03:45,821
Do you still remember? Shma yisroe, yes, I remember that too.

823
01:03:45,821 --> 01:03:49,229
But, uh, it was learned, wasn't it?

824
01:03:49,229 --> 01:03:54,229
Only because I sang it very often, er, on holidays, my brother and I, it stuck a bit.

825
01:03:54,229 --> 01:03:59,229
But it was always very nice and... They were, they were comrades. And the women.

826
01:03:59,229 --> 01:04:04,229
We used to fool around in the synagogue. We were always behind laurel trees.

827
01:04:04,229 --> 01:04:09,229
Mmm. My God. There was a Berlin, uh, margarine representative who was laughing.

828
01:04:09,229 --> 01:04:14,229
He said: "I can't sing that if, if, if, if, if I'm hungry.

829
01:04:14,229 --> 01:04:19,229
I have to acheln." Right? That was all. They were all very nice.

830
01:04:19,229 --> 01:04:24,229
Do you, uh, yes, do you, uh, believe in God, do you? Do I believe in God? Yes.

831
01:04:24,229 --> 01:04:28,416
I believe in my wife. Hm. If you like. Mhm.

832
01:04:28,416 --> 01:04:33,284
And musically, it's, uh, Gustav Mahler for me. Hm.

833
01:04:33,284 --> 01:04:38,284
And do you have these, uh, songs and also, uh, these prayers, they say? Yes.

834
01:04:38,284 --> 01:04:43,284
Did you, when you experienced difficulties late in the Third Reich?

835
01:04:43,284 --> 01:04:48,284
Did you think about these songs and- No. prayers? No, no, no.

836
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:52,763
Did you say the Shma in Russia? No, never. No.

837
01:04:52,763 --> 01:04:57,631
You know, the struggle for existence, for survival

838
01:04:57,631 --> 01:05:02,631
was the only thing that clung to your consciousness. Nothing.

839
01:05:02,631 --> 01:05:07,631
Not thinking left and right, not looking left and right, but holding on to survival, man.

840
01:05:07,631 --> 01:05:12,631
Yes? Can you imagine that? Not being able to wash your hands for eight weeks?

841
01:05:12,631 --> 01:05:17,631
No toilet? Only snow? Well. And what did you eat? Cold rations.

842
01:05:17,631 --> 01:05:22,631
But not, uh-- When we were under fire, the assholes didn't even dare to come to us.

843
01:05:22,631 --> 01:05:27,631
We had to wait until the next day for the rations to arrive and all that.

844
01:05:27,631 --> 01:05:32,631
We were all given this so-called rubber sausage. That was a hunting sausage.

845
01:05:32,631 --> 01:05:37,631
And, uh, yes, what else did we get? Oh, some canned meat. All cold.

846
01:05:37,631 --> 01:05:40,358
Never a hot meal. Only cold.

847
01:05:40,358 --> 01:05:45,358
And chocolate cola to keep us brave and, and, and, uh, cognac.

848
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:50,358
But not in quantities, of course. Mmm. And where did you sleep?

849
01:05:50,358 --> 01:05:55,358
Yes, in the-- I told you earlier, in the grenade funnel.

850
01:05:55,358 --> 01:06:00,358
We had lined it with blankets. Mhm. And was it possible to sleep there?

851
01:06:00,358 --> 01:06:05,358
Of course it was. You wouldn't believe what a person can go through.

852
01:06:05,358 --> 01:06:10,358
Young, above all, healthy. Yes. (sings) Oh, where is she? Howo? It hurts.

853
01:06:10,358 --> 01:06:15,129
It hurts. Uh. Oh, God. Well, something like that.

854
01:06:15,129 --> 01:06:20,129
(laughs) El hoo adonai, Elohenu. Yes. (laughs) Oh, just please, go on.

855
01:06:20,129 --> 01:06:25,129
No, no, no. That's all right. I've had enough now. But I'm glad you found this.

856
01:06:25,129 --> 01:06:30,129
You know the-- Shall I tell you? Yes, briefly. Yes, a quick question, yes.

857
01:06:30,129 --> 01:06:35,129
What's your name? Can you say your name? My name is Peter Wilhelm Tescher.

858
01:06:35,129 --> 01:06:40,129
Just a moment. What is your father's name? My father's name was Wilhelm Tescher.

859
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:45,129
And how did you find out about your Jewish ancestry? How did I find out?

860
01:06:45,129 --> 01:06:50,129
Actually, um, from my father's stories, um, which had a lot to do with his time as a soldier.

861
01:06:50,129 --> 01:06:55,129
And I held a piece of paper in my hand when I was relatively young.

862
01:06:55,129 --> 01:07:00,129
It was this key experience where it said that my father was allowed to become an officer with a special permit from Adolf Hitler.

863
01:07:00,129 --> 01:07:05,129
And, um - it was just a permit? It was a special permit. But not a license.

864
01:07:05,129 --> 01:07:10,129
No, no. No, no. Just a permit. It said, I can give you a copy of it again.

865
01:07:10,129 --> 01:07:15,129
Maybe we'll just make a list of the things I bring over to you.

866
01:07:15,129 --> 01:07:20,129
Um, it says on it that I reserve the right to make a final decision after the war.

867
01:07:20,129 --> 01:07:25,129
Hm. That's one story, the other story-- of course we asked: Why was that?

868
01:07:25,129 --> 01:07:30,129
And the other story is that during the war my father went to Bialystok

869
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:34,510
which was occupied by the Germans at the time

870
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:39,510
and tried to get an official certificate stating that only one of his parents

871
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:44,510
his mother, i.e. his maternal grandparent, was of Jewish descent.

872
01:07:44,510 --> 01:07:49,510
There were no more documents about this and he actually came back with this certificate from an official from this administration.

873
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:54,510
And that, uh, was then also, yes half a life insurance policy for my grandmother

874
01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:59,510
who- So actually both grandparents were Jewish? I don't know...

875
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:03,697
Well, the certificate says only one parent.

876
01:08:03,697 --> 01:08:08,697
But what did your father say about that? Uh, he was, um...

877
01:08:08,697 --> 01:08:12,689
He probably didn't know himself that-- Uh

878
01:08:12,689 --> 01:08:16,876
the story is that after the First World War

879
01:08:16,876 --> 01:08:21,355
my grandfather was also called Wilhelm Tescher

880
01:08:21,355 --> 01:08:26,355
after the First World War in 1917, after the Peace of Brest-Litovsk, uh

881
01:08:26,355 --> 01:08:31,355
administrator of a large sawmill of the German army administration-- What was his name?

882
01:08:31,355 --> 01:08:36,355
Wilhelm Tescher too, yes. Also. First World War, yes

883
01:08:36,355 --> 01:08:41,355
he was the manager of a large sawmill belonging to the German army administration in the

884
01:08:41,355 --> 01:08:46,355
uh, in the then, uh, German-occupied territories near Bialystok.

885
01:08:46,355 --> 01:08:51,355
And in the nineteen hundreds - I think they had to leave there in 1919 after the capitulation.

886
01:08:51,355 --> 01:08:56,355
And then, right? And he brought a young woman with him from there.

887
01:08:56,355 --> 01:08:58,692
That was my grandmother.

888
01:08:58,692 --> 01:09:03,692
Her name was, um, Frida Sobonitzky, she was Russian of German descent and nineteen years old.

889
01:09:03,692 --> 01:09:08,692
My grandfather was thirty-nine and my father the first-born son of this marriage

890
01:09:08,692 --> 01:09:12,879
was born in Germany at the age of nineteen.

891
01:09:12,879 --> 01:09:17,879
And my grandfather then took over my parents' small sawmill, a very small sawmill.

892
01:09:17,879 --> 01:09:22,879
And this, uh, sawmill continued to run. My grandmother was here.

893
01:09:22,879 --> 01:09:27,879
There was contact with the family in Russia until the nineteen hundreds

894
01:09:27,879 --> 01:09:32,879
until the early thirties, and then Stalin resettled everyone.

895
01:09:32,879 --> 01:09:37,879
And since then there has been no sign of life from this part of the family.

896
01:09:37,879 --> 01:09:41,189
Well, actually, it's not known, uh

897
01:09:41,189 --> 01:09:46,189
that another brother of my grandmother was in Berlin again around nineteen thirties

898
01:09:46,189 --> 01:09:51,189
as far as I've been told, and met with, with, with relatives, yes.

899
01:09:51,189 --> 01:09:56,189
But there's no longer any connection to this, to these grandparents, to these relatives.

900
01:09:56,189 --> 01:10:01,189
Uh, the grandmother was there too and didn't see that as a problem with us.

901
01:10:01,189 --> 01:10:06,189
And with the seizure of power came difficulties for my father.

902
01:10:06,189 --> 01:10:10,279
He wasn't allowed to get married to Wedern

903
01:10:10,279 --> 01:10:15,279
he wasn't allowed to-- There were also difficulties with school.

904
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:20,245
He then changed schools and couldn't do his Abitur.

905
01:10:20,245 --> 01:10:25,245
Hm.quarry with us, which incidentally was built in the Westwall.

906
01:10:25,245 --> 01:10:30,245
If the Jewish grandmother, she was born... You can look that up.

907
01:10:30,245 --> 01:10:35,245
We have a proof of ancestry, but I don't have it with me now. I can also...

908
01:10:35,245 --> 01:10:40,245
I'll write down what I... Or is she writing? Yes, I'll write it down.

909
01:10:40,245 --> 01:10:43,166
So that I can give you this...

910
01:10:43,166 --> 01:10:48,166
Yes, every document is very important if you have a lot of documents out there.

911
01:10:48,166 --> 01:10:53,166
Yes. Well, that would be the proof of ancestry, I have that somewhere.

912
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:57,060
The authorization. Yes, so this history.

913
01:10:57,060 --> 01:11:02,060
And my grandmother isn't in any danger, at least not for the time being

914
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:05,566
because my family is very respected.

915
01:11:05,566 --> 01:11:10,566
Although in a neighboring village a whole bunch of Jews got away

916
01:11:10,566 --> 01:11:15,566
but my grandmother, that was somewhere, that's how it was.

917
01:11:15,566 --> 01:11:20,566
There were no problems. Only my father had some problems.

918
01:11:20,566 --> 01:11:25,566
My father then became a soldier in 1939, took part in the French campaign

919
01:11:25,566 --> 01:11:30,566
in the first attacks, and after the French campaign he rejoined the pioneers.

920
01:11:30,566 --> 01:11:34,947
He had huge casualties in the first few days.

921
01:11:34,947 --> 01:11:38,550
He was with the first river pioneers.

922
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:43,550
Then he came back to Mainz in the Galisodes and later, after the coal addiction...

923
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:48,418
This is now a Mr. Hossen. Am I in the right place?

924
01:11:48,418 --> 01:11:53,418
I'm in the right place, right? Yes, yes. I have... Mr.

925
01:11:53,418 --> 01:11:58,418
Brosset, Lieutenant Janzen. I just want to put something here for Mrs. Schümmer.

926
01:11:58,418 --> 01:12:03,418
Here you are. I was looking for you. You were at emart. Don't worry.

927
01:12:03,418 --> 01:12:08,418
My father went with me to Russia when they went out.

928
01:12:08,418 --> 01:12:13,418
He was always in the front line and also received forty-two German Gold.

929
01:12:13,418 --> 01:12:16,047
And what did he get it for?

930
01:12:16,047 --> 01:12:21,047
We didn't talk much about direct war-related measures.

931
01:12:21,047 --> 01:12:26,047
I only know that my father led the remnants of a pioneer battalion out of the fighting for weeks

932
01:12:26,047 --> 01:12:31,047
or at least for days, as an Obergfreiter at the time and, among other things

933
01:12:31,047 --> 01:12:36,047
I believe, in connection with a serious injury to his commander.

934
01:12:36,047 --> 01:12:41,047
He's still alive, by the way. I can give you his name.

935
01:12:41,047 --> 01:12:45,137
Maybe you should talk to him on the phone.

936
01:12:45,137 --> 01:12:50,137
He was his commander for many years afterwards. That's Schmischkel.

937
01:12:50,137 --> 01:12:54,713
I think he was also a colonel, or I don't know.

938
01:12:54,713 --> 01:12:59,713
So Schmichkel, Helmut Schmichkel. And I'll write it down for you, the address.

939
01:12:59,713 --> 01:13:04,713
And did her sibling, Father, also get permission from Hinter? No.

940
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:09,713
So there were two sisters and a brother and the brother was also a soldier.

941
01:13:09,713 --> 01:13:13,997
What was the brother's name? Fritz Brescher.

942
01:13:13,997 --> 01:13:18,997
Lives in Kloster Reichenbach near Freudenstadt here at Vogelherd.

943
01:13:18,997 --> 01:13:23,997
If he can't be reached there, he can be contacted via the Tröscher and Beilharz company.

944
01:13:23,997 --> 01:13:27,795
But we can organize that somehow later.

945
01:13:27,795 --> 01:13:32,795
As far as I know, Franz Tröscher was a prisoner for a long time.

946
01:13:32,795 --> 01:13:37,795
He had probably become a sergeant, a paymaster or something.

947
01:13:37,795 --> 01:13:42,795
I think the Russians kept the paymasters for a long time.

948
01:13:42,795 --> 01:13:47,795
Somehow he only came back from captivity at the beginning of the fifties.

949
01:13:47,795 --> 01:13:52,795
And then he took over the sawmill at home and is now also a timber merchant here in Freudenstadt.

950
01:13:52,795 --> 01:13:57,761
Yes, and my father then... Then he was suggested...

951
01:13:57,761 --> 01:14:02,761
So his superiors tried to get him to become an officer.

952
01:14:02,761 --> 01:14:05,974
And then, on the one hand... Well

953
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:10,974
I don't remember exactly whether this certificate from Bialostock was needed at home to protect my grandmother or rather so that he could do an officer's course.

954
01:14:10,974 --> 01:14:15,974
In any case, with this special permit from Hitler, which I just...

955
01:14:15,974 --> 01:14:18,311
These are simpler files.

956
01:14:18,311 --> 01:14:23,311
So it only says Hitler, but it was actually decided by Hitler himself

957
01:14:23,311 --> 01:14:28,311
he was able to attend the officers' course in Dessau, completed this course

958
01:14:28,311 --> 01:14:32,497
as far as I know, as the best of the course

959
01:14:32,497 --> 01:14:37,497
then also experienced Hitler up close for the first time at the end

960
01:14:37,497 --> 01:14:42,497
at the end of this course, because Hitler himself passed this course, in 1943.

961
01:14:42,497 --> 01:14:47,497
Really? Yes, he went to Dessau, flew and said goodbye to this course.

962
01:14:47,497 --> 01:14:51,100
That was the last, probably the last.

963
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:56,100
And then after a relatively short time he probably became a lieutenant and was then transferred from Russia to Italy and was back on the Russian front in the last days of the war.

964
01:14:56,100 --> 01:15:01,100
But we didn't actually talk that much about the war itself.

965
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:04,508
It was more of a fundamental thing.

966
01:15:04,508 --> 01:15:09,508
And as a first lieutenant in the American, but then British...

967
01:15:09,508 --> 01:15:14,508
I think the Americans did it in England or something

968
01:15:14,508 --> 01:15:19,508
so he was an English prisoner and then - he was back home very early

969
01:15:19,508 --> 01:15:22,040
was of course unencumbered

970
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:27,040
he actually came out as a convinced pacifist after the crisis

971
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:29,474
but he was also a realist

972
01:15:29,474 --> 01:15:34,474
he first rebuilt the sawmill and then joined the KPD back then

973
01:15:34,474 --> 01:15:36,519
so he was a communist

974
01:15:36,519 --> 01:15:41,519
and after a relatively short time he took over the mayor's post in our town on a temporary basis and then

975
01:15:41,519 --> 01:15:44,926
at the age of twenty-eight, in 1948

976
01:15:44,926 --> 01:15:49,926
he was also elected mayor of the municipality or district.

977
01:15:49,926 --> 01:15:53,140
That was his entry into politics.

978
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:58,140
Then he was fifty-five in the state parliament, fifty-seven in the Bundestag

979
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:03,140
the European Parliament, and then, well, he became Federal Chancellor.

980
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:08,140
And was your father proud of this German cross and gold?

981
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:13,140
Uh, I think my father was everywhere he was in his life, he tried to make the best of it.

982
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:18,140
I think he was, yes, I think he was someone who, you know, with everyone.

983
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:23,140
He was always very much, very gladly and very quickly responsible for other people.

984
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:27,229
And that is of course also in the long war

985
01:16:27,229 --> 01:16:32,229
regardless of whether you think he was unjust or just, um

986
01:16:32,229 --> 01:16:37,195
it's an ability that comes through very quickly. So

987
01:16:37,195 --> 01:16:42,195
he was a leader in every respect and I believe that this bravery was not something that was purely personal

988
01:16:42,195 --> 01:16:43,947
yes, to gain honor

989
01:16:43,947 --> 01:16:48,947
but that in this situation he also took matters into his own hands for others and

990
01:16:48,947 --> 01:16:51,187
of course, for himself.

991
01:16:51,187 --> 01:16:56,187
Yes, I believe that he tackled everything in his life with great courage.

992
01:16:56,187 --> 01:16:58,913
And it's hard to judge that.

993
01:16:58,913 --> 01:17:03,913
I myself was a soldier in the Bundeswehr, er, in peacetime.

994
01:17:03,913 --> 01:17:08,913
And it's very difficult to judge, um, how this situation, this war

995
01:17:08,913 --> 01:17:13,913
is always progressing, that your friend the pioneers, yes, a lot

996
01:17:13,913 --> 01:17:18,913
have had a lot of losses, how that affects your attitude to life.

997
01:17:18,913 --> 01:17:23,913
So you always had the feeling that he dealt with danger very calmly.

998
01:17:23,913 --> 01:17:28,913
Even afterwards, I have to say, with the threat that he knew, um, his own

999
01:17:28,913 --> 01:17:33,913
his own difficult life situation, uh, no situation at all.

1000
01:17:33,913 --> 01:17:38,913
He worked until the end and then died in Hamburg at an SPD party conference shortly before he was due to give a speech.

1001
01:17:38,913 --> 01:17:43,913
(sighs) Yes, so it's, it's changed a lot, this, this wartime.

1002
01:17:43,913 --> 01:17:48,879
I think he once wrote, perhaps I can also find this

1003
01:17:48,879 --> 01:17:52,190
that it was only in this situation

1004
01:17:52,190 --> 01:17:56,961
in which he experienced Hitler so closely in 1943

1005
01:17:56,961 --> 01:18:01,961
that he knew from that moment on that this man was crazy

1006
01:18:01,961 --> 01:18:06,732
that this man was a madman and that a catastrophe

1007
01:18:06,732 --> 01:18:10,334
which one certainly already suspected

1008
01:18:10,334 --> 01:18:15,334
but from that moment on he probably knew that this catastrophe could no longer

1009
01:18:15,334 --> 01:18:20,334
could no longer be contained. So, what did he think about his permit?

1010
01:18:20,334 --> 01:18:25,334
(sighs) Well, signed by Hitler, the mercy of the Führer.

1011
01:18:25,334 --> 01:18:30,334
So I don't think that my father, that my father's Jewish origins played a role.

1012
01:18:30,334 --> 01:18:35,334
My father was always a citizen of the world, even as a young man, when I didn't yet know him.

1013
01:18:35,334 --> 01:18:40,334
Even as a secondary school pupil, he read English and French newspapers

1014
01:18:40,334 --> 01:18:43,840
spoke five or six languages fluently

1015
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:48,840
tried to learn a bit of Russian through these relatives

1016
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:53,840
but I don't think that this idea of being Jewish played any role at all.

1017
01:18:53,840 --> 01:18:58,611
Uh, that, well, I don't think so. Did you... Yes.

1018
01:18:58,611 --> 01:19:03,611
Yes, did you lose any relatives in the Holocaust? No. Well, not in Germany.

1019
01:19:03,611 --> 01:19:08,090
My grandmother was the only one who came over.

1020
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:13,090
We certainly lost relatives, but we don't know that, through Stalin's deportation.

1021
01:19:13,090 --> 01:19:18,090
Mmm. Yes. So in that respect, we're not, we're certainly not the typical, uh

1022
01:19:18,090 --> 01:19:23,055
family that lived in Germany with Jewish relatives.

1023
01:19:23,055 --> 01:19:27,242
It was just my grandmother, who was also...

1024
01:19:27,242 --> 01:19:32,242
The authorities didn't want to know exactly whether she was of half or quarter or full Jewish descent.

1025
01:19:32,242 --> 01:19:32,632
Mhm.

1026
01:19:32,632 --> 01:19:37,632
That-- But my uncle, who lived through that time, can probably tell you a lot more about that.

1027
01:19:37,632 --> 01:19:42,632
(crosstalk 00:04:48) And your father's friend, who wrote to me

1028
01:19:42,632 --> 01:19:47,632
said that your father said that his Jewish grandmother was completely Jewish.

1029
01:19:47,632 --> 01:19:52,632
It could be, it could be. Well, we didn't really talk much about that.

1030
01:19:52,632 --> 01:19:57,632
Uh, about-- you, well, it didn't really matter to us whether she was completely...

1031
01:19:57,632 --> 01:20:02,632
It was important that he got this certificate, but for us, uh, it's

1032
01:20:02,632 --> 01:20:07,632
and that's the same for us today, so, we're, um-our country.

1033
01:20:07,632 --> 01:20:12,632
We are aware of that. We've always been a country where cultures have mixed.

1034
01:20:12,632 --> 01:20:17,632
Where we come from, Roman influences are still very much in evidence.

1035
01:20:17,632 --> 01:20:22,632
And the progenitor, the first thresher, can be traced back to the Thirty Years' War.

1036
01:20:22,632 --> 01:20:27,632
I'll come back to that, also with genealogical research

1037
01:20:27,632 --> 01:20:32,632
he was a Swedish mercenary who came to Germany with Gustav Adolf and then got stuck with us

1038
01:20:32,632 --> 01:20:36,137
so he married an impostor. So for us

1039
01:20:36,137 --> 01:20:41,137
I would say that having Jewish ancestors is neither something to do with pride nor something to do with shame.

1040
01:20:41,137 --> 01:20:46,137
It's something that actually comes quite naturally to us.

1041
01:20:46,137 --> 01:20:51,137
We are six siblings and I think we all feel that way and yes

1042
01:20:51,137 --> 01:20:56,137
that's what I can actually tell you now. Doing something for people.

1043
01:20:56,137 --> 01:21:01,137
I also don't believe that he committed any atrocities without need or anything.

1044
01:21:01,137 --> 01:21:04,545
He was actually too human for that.

1045
01:21:04,545 --> 01:21:09,545
But war is an exceptional situation and I can't imagine it for someone who isn't war-minded.

1046
01:21:09,545 --> 01:21:13,148
You probably feel the same way. I do.

1047
01:21:13,148 --> 01:21:18,148
It's a situation that you only really know if you've experienced it.

1048
01:21:18,148 --> 01:21:22,334
Did he learn about the Holocaust back then?

1049
01:21:22,334 --> 01:21:27,334
I assume that at least from 1943 onwards, 44 would have been aware of some things there too.

1050
01:21:27,334 --> 01:21:32,334
I assume that. But. Difficult. Difficult to say. Did he talk about it?

1051
01:21:32,334 --> 01:21:35,548
He actually only talked about it.

1052
01:21:35,548 --> 01:21:40,548
After the war, he was always very consciously against.

1053
01:21:40,548 --> 01:21:45,548
For example, as state chairman of the SPD, which he was a strong voice

1054
01:21:45,548 --> 01:21:50,548
he chaired the parliamentary group in the state parliament.

1055
01:21:50,548 --> 01:21:55,548
In Mainz, he did not attend American receptions during the Vietnam War

1056
01:21:55,548 --> 01:22:00,548
which he considered to be an unjust war, which was a huge scandal.

1057
01:22:00,548 --> 01:22:05,548
So he had a lot of self-confidence and moral courage when he thought that injustice was being done.

1058
01:22:05,548 --> 01:22:10,548
And then he did. He didn't stand up for himself, he didn't do it.

1059
01:22:10,548 --> 01:22:15,548
He didn't go there and he wrote to them to explain why he wasn't coming.

1060
01:22:15,548 --> 01:22:20,221
And that's in a state like Rhineland-Palatinate.

1061
01:22:20,221 --> 01:22:25,221
There was a huge uproar and scandal that someone didn't go to see his American friends.

1062
01:22:25,221 --> 01:22:30,221
He did things like that. He was affected by these experiences after the war.

1063
01:22:30,221 --> 01:22:35,221
I think it was more of a reinforcement or an imprint on his personality

1064
01:22:35,221 --> 01:22:38,629
which then developed after the war.

1065
01:22:38,629 --> 01:22:43,629
I was born shortly after the war and I witnessed a lot of people who then expressed themselves in such a way that he really fought very

1066
01:22:43,629 --> 01:22:48,629
very hard for peace, for justice, for social justice, for development

1067
01:22:48,629 --> 01:22:52,621
for international understanding and so on

1068
01:22:52,621 --> 01:22:57,621
that we can actually talk about very personal experiences in the war

1069
01:22:57,621 --> 01:23:02,621
which I'm sure we did. You can't survive a war like that without feeling guilty.

1070
01:23:02,621 --> 01:23:07,621
I don't think that's possible. But we never really talked about that.

1071
01:23:07,621 --> 01:23:12,621
I believe that his personality was shaped by these experiences

1072
01:23:12,621 --> 01:23:16,711
which he ultimately classified as terrible

1073
01:23:16,711 --> 01:23:21,711
but which he faced up to as the person he was by trying to become a hero. Yes.

1074
01:23:21,711 --> 01:23:26,711
They didn't come about because he somehow only ever stood up for a just cause

1075
01:23:26,711 --> 01:23:31,711
but because you make decisions and take things into your own hands in situations where your own life and the lives of your comrades are at stake.

1076
01:23:31,711 --> 01:23:36,711
And I assume that it was more this imprint that played a role later on

1077
01:23:36,711 --> 01:23:41,711
which was the sum of the experiences during the war.

1078
01:23:41,711 --> 01:23:46,711
There is a brochure from the political period that also contains a bit about the war.

1079
01:23:46,711 --> 01:23:51,711
I will enclose it when I send it to you. Before we talk about your list.

1080
01:23:51,711 --> 01:23:56,711
Can you tell me your name? What is your name? Friedrich Christian Stahl.

1081
01:23:56,711 --> 01:24:01,579
When were you born? On October 28, 1918 in Berlin.

1082
01:24:01,579 --> 01:24:05,669
And you talked about Labram a bit earlier.

1083
01:24:05,669 --> 01:24:10,669
How did you know that Heinrich Labram had experienced so many problems?

1084
01:24:10,669 --> 01:24:12,811
We were both together.

1085
01:24:12,811 --> 01:24:17,811
We were both heads of department at the Military History Research Office

1086
01:24:17,811 --> 01:24:22,811
so we often spoke to each other and also socialized with each other.

1087
01:24:22,811 --> 01:24:27,811
And what did he say about his experience in the Kriegsmarine?

1088
01:24:27,811 --> 01:24:32,811
Paraprophe came out and the Jewish officers who had not taken part in the First World War were to be excluded from the Wehrmacht.

1089
01:24:32,811 --> 01:24:33,882
In his case

1090
01:24:33,882 --> 01:24:38,882
it was particularly tragic because his brother had already crashed after 1933 or in 1933 as a trained aviation officer.

1091
01:24:38,882 --> 01:24:43,882
When the question came to him, he himself asked to speak to his high commander, Admiral Raeder.

1092
01:24:43,882 --> 01:24:48,653
He was refused. And he was very angry about that.

1093
01:24:48,653 --> 01:24:53,653
After the war, did he try to have a court case with ??? did he?

1094
01:24:53,653 --> 01:24:58,619
I don't think so. He didn't talk about that either.

1095
01:24:58,619 --> 01:25:03,619
I think we've finished the Lebram case. Then I spoke about Österreicher.

1096
01:25:03,619 --> 01:25:08,619
Österreicher was a lieutenant in motorized division seven, which was in Munich.

1097
01:25:08,619 --> 01:25:13,390
And- From the first name, you know? I don't know.

1098
01:25:13,390 --> 01:25:18,390
You know, the first name never played a role in the German army.

1099
01:25:18,390 --> 01:25:23,390
Or let's say in the Prussian, in the Bavarian, yes. Okay.

1100
01:25:23,390 --> 01:25:28,390
(Laughter) I only know the case and I know that Österreicher survived the war.

1101
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:33,390
Hm. That's all I can say. And he had been with your father?

1102
01:25:33,390 --> 01:25:38,390
How did you know that he was an officer candidate with my father, i.e.

1103
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:43,356
as an ensign and midshipman at the infantry school.

1104
01:25:43,356 --> 01:25:48,029
My father was a teacher for the midshipmen, i.e.

1105
01:25:48,029 --> 01:25:52,314
for the second course at the infantry school

1106
01:25:52,314 --> 01:25:57,314
and that's how I got to know all of them - there were only ten of them for the motorized troops

1107
01:25:57,314 --> 01:26:01,598
for example. And what was going on with him?

1108
01:26:01,598 --> 01:26:06,598
Did he have a Jewish parent or big ones? I don't know that.

1109
01:26:06,598 --> 01:26:11,598
I only knew him until he was nineteen thirty-one or thirty-two and not after that.

1110
01:26:11,598 --> 01:26:16,598
And ah yes, was, did he get a declaration of German blood?

1111
01:26:16,598 --> 01:26:21,598
How was it possible that he stayed in the German Wehrmacht?

1112
01:26:21,598 --> 01:26:26,598
No, no, he didn't get a declaration of German blood, because he had to leave.

1113
01:26:26,598 --> 01:26:31,077
So he was discharged first? Yes. The next one?

1114
01:26:31,077 --> 01:26:36,077
Yes, then there are some cases where I just want to say the name.

1115
01:26:36,077 --> 01:26:41,077
I'm sure you're familiar with these cases. I've already said Backenköhler. Mhm.

1116
01:26:41,077 --> 01:26:46,077
You will of course be familiar with Wilberg. Milk. And Backenköhler.

1117
01:26:46,077 --> 01:26:51,077
You have an interesting story about the naval adjutant.

1118
01:26:51,077 --> 01:26:56,077
I remember that either Raeder's adjutant or a personnel officer or the head of the naval personnel office came to Raeder and drew his attention to the order that naval officers of Jewish descent had to be dismissed.

1119
01:26:56,077 --> 01:26:59,095
And Raeder is said to have said

1120
01:26:59,095 --> 01:27:04,095
"That doesn't concern the navy." To which the man in question replied, "But Mr.

1121
01:27:04,095 --> 01:27:09,095
Admiral," and mentioned several names, including Backenköhler. Hm.

1122
01:27:09,095 --> 01:27:12,211
I can't say any more about that.

1123
01:27:12,211 --> 01:27:17,211
It was all a very long time ago that I heard that and I don't remember who said it.

1124
01:27:17,211 --> 01:27:22,211
Mhm. Then there was the case of General Kühntal, military attaché in Paris.

1125
01:27:22,211 --> 01:27:26,300
Kühlintal? Kühlintal, yes. Ah The admiral?

1126
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:31,300
The admiral is, if I'm not mistaken, a brother of his. I see.

1127
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:36,364
Yes, he came out of the war mine in nineteen-twenty.
