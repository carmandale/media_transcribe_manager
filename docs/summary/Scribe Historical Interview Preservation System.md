# Scribe: Historical Interview Preservation System

  Executive Summary

  Project Overview

  Scribe is a specialized digital preservation platform designed to unlock the historical value of
  oral testimonies through automated transcription, multi-language translation, and AI-powered
  content discovery. The system currently preserves 726 interviews with Jews who served in the Nazi 
  military - a unique and historically significant collection that represents one of the most complex
   and understudied aspects of Holocaust history.

  DeepL and OpenAI GPT-4
- Quality Assurance: Automated evaluation of translation accuracy with specialized scoring for
  complex languages like Hebrew
- Batch Processing: Handles hundreds of interviews through fully automated pipeline

  Digital Access Platform
- Synchronized Playback: Video/audio with perfectly timed subtitles in any supported language
- Advanced Search: Full-text search across all interview transcripts with intelligent snippet
  generation
- Citation Support: Precise timestamps for academic referencing and source verification
- Multi-Format Export: Standard SRT subtitle files for integration with other research tools

  Current Impact

  Production Deployment: Successfully processed all 726 interviews representing hundreds of hours of
  historical testimony
  Multi-Language Access: Content available in original languages plus English, German, and Hebrew
  translations
  Academic Ready: Complete citation system with timestamps for scholarly research and publication

  Technological Innovation

  Historical Accuracy Focus: Unlike generic transcription services, Scribe is optimized for
  historical content, properly handling names, places, and historical events that standard AI systems
   often misinterpret.

  Preservation-First Architecture: Built for long-term digital preservation with comprehensive backup
   systems, audit trails, and format standards that ensure content remains accessible for decades.

  Research Integration: Designed specifically for historian workflows with features like synchronized
   transcripts, academic citation formats, and seamless integration with research methodologies.

  Target Users

  Primary: Academic historians, museum curators, and educational institutions studying Holocaust
  history and Jewish military service
  Secondary: Genealogists, documentary filmmakers, and digital archivists working with historical
  testimonies
  Future: Global research community studying oral history and testimony preservation

  Next-Generation Features (In Development)

  AI-Powered Research Assistant: Natural language chat interface allowing historians to ask questions
   like "What stories do they tell about the Eastern Front?" and receive synthesized responses with
  specific interview citations and timestamps.

  Semantic Discovery: Advanced AI understanding that connects related themes, emotions, and
  experiences across the entire collection, enabling researchers to discover patterns and connections
   previously impossible to find manually.

  Strategic Value

  Scribe represents a breakthrough in making historical testimonies accessible across language
  barriers while maintaining scholarly rigor. The platform transforms isolated audio/video files into
   a searchable, citable, and analyzable research corpus that serves both current academic needs and
  long-term preservation goals.

  Current State: Production-ready with 726 processed interviews
  Immediate Opportunity: AI chat system to revolutionize historical research workflows
  Long-term Vision: Scalable platform for preserving and accessing oral histories globally
