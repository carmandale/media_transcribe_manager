# Scribe System Validation & Trust Implementation PRD

## Project Overview
The Scribe system currently has critical data integrity issues where the database reports 100% completion for Hebrew translations but only ~48% are actually complete. This project will implement comprehensive validation, fix existing issues, and establish trust in the system.

## Current State
- 728 total files in the system
- English: 100% complete (728 valid files)
- German: 100% complete (728 valid files)
- Hebrew: ~48% actually complete (349 valid, 328 with placeholders, 51 missing)
- Database incorrectly reports 100% completion
- No content validation exists
- No mandatory evaluation before marking translations complete

## Project Goals
1. Fix all existing Hebrew translations (379 files total)
2. Implement robust content validation
3. Add database integrity checks
4. Enforce mandatory evaluation before completion
5. Create comprehensive test suite
6. Establish monitoring and alerts

## Technical Requirements

### Phase 1: System Audit & Database Correction
- Create comprehensive audit script to identify all issues
- Fix database to reflect actual file system state
- Document all discrepancies found
- Create backup of current state before changes

### Phase 2: Hebrew Translation Fixes
- Complete translation of 328 files with [HEBREW TRANSLATION] placeholders
- Create 51 missing Hebrew translation files
- Implement parallel processing for efficiency
- Track API costs (estimated $200-300)
- Validate each translation before marking complete

### Phase 3: Content Validation Implementation
- Add validate_translation_content() method to database.py
- Check file existence
- Detect and reject placeholder content
- Implement language detection (Hebrew characters, German indicators)
- Return detailed validation status and issues

### Phase 4: Database Integrity System
- Implement validate_and_fix_status() method
- Check all translation files exist
- Validate content of each file
- Update database to match reality
- Create detailed change logs

### Phase 5: Pipeline Integration
- Modify translation pipeline to require evaluation
- No translation marked complete without:
  - File existence check
  - Content validation (correct language, no placeholders)
  - Quality evaluation score >= 7.0
- Add validation hooks at each pipeline stage

### Phase 6: Test Suite Creation
- Create test_translation_integrity.py
- Test for no placeholders in completed translations
- Test Hebrew files contain actual Hebrew text
- Test database matches filesystem
- Test evaluation coverage requirements

### Phase 7: Monitoring & Reporting
- Daily validation report generation
- Alert system for completed translations with issues
- Track evaluation coverage (must reach 100%)
- Create dashboard for system health

## Success Criteria
- 100% of "completed" translations have valid files
- 100% of Hebrew files contain Hebrew text (no placeholders)
- 100% of translations have quality evaluation
- Database can be trusted as single source of truth
- No translation can be marked complete without validation
- All tests pass consistently

## Technical Stack
- Python 3.x
- SQLite database
- OpenAI API for translations
- asyncio for parallel processing
- pytest for testing

## Estimated Timeline
- Phase 1: 2-3 hours (audit and database fixes)
- Phase 2: 4-6 hours (Hebrew retranslation with parallel processing)
- Phase 3: 2 hours (content validation implementation)
- Phase 4: 2 hours (database integrity)
- Phase 5: 2 hours (pipeline integration)
- Phase 6: 3 hours (test suite)
- Phase 7: 2 hours (monitoring setup)
- Total: ~20 hours of development

## Risk Mitigation
- Create full backup before any database changes
- Test all changes on small subset first
- Implement rollback procedures
- Monitor API costs during retranslation
- Create detailed logs for all operations
