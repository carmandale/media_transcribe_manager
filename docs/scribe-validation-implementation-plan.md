# Scribe System Validation & Trust Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

The Scribe system has critical data integrity issues where the database reports 100% completion for Hebrew translations but only ~48% are actually complete (349 valid, 328 with placeholders, 51 missing). This document outlines a comprehensive plan to fix these issues and establish trust in the system.

## Key Findings from Validation

1. **Database Trust Issues:**
   - 328 Hebrew files marked "completed" contain only placeholders
   - 51 files marked complete have no Hebrew file at all
   - Database reports 100% completion but reality is ~48% actual Hebrew translations

2. **Evaluation Coverage:**
   - Only 258 out of 728 files were ever evaluated
   - Files with placeholders were never run through evaluation

3. **Cost Impact:**
   - ~$200-300 estimated for Hebrew retranslation
   - ~20 hours of development effort

## Implementation Workflow

### Roles
- **Claude**: Developer - implements tasks, logs progress, prepares summaries
- **Supervisor (You)**: Reviews work, validates implementation, ensures accuracy

### Process
1. Claude implements each task/subtask
2. Claude uses `update_subtask` to log progress and findings
3. Claude prepares implementation summary
4. Supervisor reviews using tools (read_file, run tests, validate outputs)
5. Supervisor approves or requests changes
6. Move to next task

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Emergency Stabilization (Tasks 1-3)
**Goal**: Stop the bleeding and understand the damage

#### Task 1: Create Comprehensive System Backup
- **Priority**: High
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Subtasks**:
  1. Prepare Backup Directory and Timestamping
  2. Backup Database File
  3. Backup Translation Directories for Each Language
  4. Generate and Verify Manifest File with State Statistics

#### Task 2: Implement Comprehensive Audit Script
- **Priority**: High
- **Dependencies**: Task 1
- **Subtasks**:
  1. Design Audit Data Structures
  2. Implement Async File Reading and Analysis
  3. Compare Database and Filesystem for Discrepancies
  4. Generate JSON Report with Statistics
  5. Validate Audit Results Against Known Issues

#### Task 3: Fix Database Status Accuracy
- **Priority**: High
- **Dependencies**: Task 2
- **Subtasks**:
  1. Parse Audit Results for Incomplete Files
  2. Implement Database Update Logic with Transaction Safety
  3. Update Status Fields and Timestamps
  4. Test and Verify Rollback on Error

### Phase 2: Hebrew Translation Fixes (Tasks 4-6)
**Goal**: Fix the 379 problematic Hebrew files

#### Task 4: Setup OpenAI API Integration for Retranslation
- Configure client with rate limiting and cost tracking

#### Task 5: Implement Parallel Hebrew Translation Pipeline
- Create efficient asyncio-based parallel processing

#### Task 6: Create Missing Hebrew Translation Files
- Generate the 51 missing files

### Phase 3: Content Validation Implementation (Tasks 7-8)
**Goal**: Build trust verification systems

#### Task 7: Implement Content Validation Module
- Add validate_translation_content() to database.py

#### Task 8: Implement Database Integrity Validation System
- Create validate_and_fix_status() method

### Phase 4: Pipeline Integration (Tasks 9-10)
**Goal**: Prevent future issues

#### Task 9: Modify Translation Pipeline for Mandatory Evaluation
- Require evaluation before marking complete

#### Task 10: Add Validation Hooks to Pipeline Stages
- Implement stage-specific validation

### Phase 5: Test Suite Creation (Tasks 11-15)
**Goal**: Automated verification

#### Task 11-15: Comprehensive Test Suite
- Foundation setup
- Placeholder detection
- Hebrew validation
- Database-filesystem consistency
- Evaluation coverage

### Phase 6: Monitoring & Reporting (Tasks 16-18)
**Goal**: Ongoing system health

#### Task 16-18: Monitoring Infrastructure
- Daily reports
- Alert system
- Health dashboard

### Phase 7: Safety & Documentation (Tasks 19-20)
**Goal**: Production readiness

#### Task 19-20: Recovery & Documentation
- Rollback procedures
- Comprehensive documentation

## Validation Criteria

Each phase must meet these criteria before proceeding:

1. **Code Review**: All code changes reviewed and approved
2. **Test Coverage**: All new code has appropriate tests
3. **Documentation**: Changes documented in code and user docs
4. **Validation**: Manual testing confirms expected behavior
5. **No Regression**: Existing functionality still works

## Critical Files to Monitor

- `scribe/database.py` - Core database operations
- `validate_all_translations.py` - Validation script
- `validation_report.txt` - Latest validation results
- `validation_issues.json` - Detailed issue list
- `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json` - Task tracking

## Success Metrics

- 100% of "completed" translations have valid files
- 100% of Hebrew files contain Hebrew text (no placeholders)
- 100% of translations have quality evaluation
- Database can be trusted as single source of truth
- All tests pass consistently
