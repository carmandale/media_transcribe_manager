### 📋 Validation Process

#### Step 1: Complete Processing
```bash
# Check for incomplete files
uv run python scripts/check_incomplete.py

# Fix any incomplete files
uv run python scripts/media_processor.py --file-id [FILE_ID] --force
```

#### Step 2: Run Quality Evaluations
```bash
# Evaluate all unevaluated files
uv run python scripts/batch_evaluate_quality.py --unevaluated-only

# Check evaluation progress
uv run python scripts/generate_quality_report.py
```

#### Step 3: Fix Below-Threshold Files
```bash
# Identify files needing improvement
uv run python scripts/db_query.py --format table "SELECT file_id, language, score FROM quality_evaluations WHERE score < 8.0 ORDER BY score"

# Re-process low-scoring translations
uv run python scripts/process_translations.py --file-id [FILE_ID] --language [LANG] --force
```

#### Step 4: Generate Missing Subtitles
```bash
# Check for missing subtitles
uv run python scripts/end_to_end_validation.py --all --save-report

# Generate missing subtitles
uv run python scripts/generate_subtitles.py --missing-only
```

#### Step 5: Final Validation
```bash
# Run comprehensive validation
uv run python scripts/end_to_end_validation.py --all --save-report

# Generate final quality report
uv run python scripts/generate_quality_report.py --format html
```

### ⚠️ Critical Checks

Before final delivery, ensure:
1. No files have quality scores below 8.0
2. All 729 files have complete output sets
3. Quality evaluation documentation is complete
4. Processing logs show no errors
5. Backup of all data exists

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

**If files fail quality evaluation:**
1. Check the specific issues in the evaluation
2. Review the original transcript for accuracy
3. Adjust translation parameters if needed
4. Re-run translation with improved prompts

**If subtitles are missing:**
1. Verify translation files exist
2. Check for special characters in file names
3. Run subtitle generation with error logging
4. Manually create if automated generation fails

**If processing is stuck:**
1. Check database for locked status
2. Reset file status to pending
3. Run with increased logging
4. Monitor system resources
