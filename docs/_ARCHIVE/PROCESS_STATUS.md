# Process Status Report

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the current status of the transcription and translation pipeline and the actions we've taken to address issues.

## Current Status

As of May 4, 2025:

### Transcription
- Completed: 717 files
- In progress: 0 files
- Failed: 11 files (currently being processed)
- Total: 728 files

### Translations
- English:
  - Completed: 655 files
  - Not started: 11 files
  - Failed: 6 files
  - Other statuses (qa_completed, qa_failed): 56 files

- German:
  - Completed: 651 files
  - Not started: 11 files
  - Failed: 13 files
  - Other statuses: 53 files

- Hebrew:
  - Completed: 598 files
  - Not started: 11 files
  - Failed: 23 files
  - Other statuses: 96 files

## Recent Actions Taken

1. **Identified Missing Transcripts**
   - Found 11 files marked as having completed transcription but actually missing transcript files
   - Created a script (fix_missing_transcripts.py) to identify and fix these discrepancies
   - Reset the transcription status for these files to 'failed'

2. **Enhanced Parallel Processing**
   - Updated parallel_transcription.py to also process files with 'failed' status
   - Updated parallel_translation.py to better handle missing transcript files by marking translations as failed
   - Created additional helper scripts for fixing database inconsistencies

3. **Implemented Process Monitoring**
   - Created tools to detect and report on process status
   - Enhanced error handling in both transcription and translation processes
   - Improved database consistency checks

4. **Active Processing**
   - Currently processing the 11 failed transcription files
   - Once transcription completes, translations will be processed

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Transcriptions**
   - Allow the current batch of 11 transcriptions to complete
   - Verify all files have been properly transcribed

2. **Run Translations**
   - After all transcriptions are complete, run translations for the remaining files:
     ```bash
     python parallel_translation.py --language he --workers 2 --batch-size 10
     python parallel_translation.py --language de --workers 2 --batch-size 10
     python parallel_translation.py --language en --workers 2 --batch-size 10
     ```

3. **Generate Final Report**
   - When all processing is complete, generate a final report on the processing status
   - Document the parallel processing improvements and performance metrics

## Monitoring

To check the current status:

```bash
# Check overall process status
python process_status.py

# Check for missing transcripts
python fix_missing_transcripts.py

# Check for stalled processes
python check_stuck_files.py
```

## Conclusion

The parallel processing system is working effectively, with most files already processed. The remaining files are being actively transcribed and will be translated as soon as transcription completes.
