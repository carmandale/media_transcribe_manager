# Comprehensive Improvement Plan

## Current Status (May 2025)

### Project Overview
The Scribe project processes 728 historical audio/video interview files through a pipeline that includes:
- Transcription using ElevenLabs
- Translation to multiple languages (English, German, Hebrew)
- Quality assurance and review

### Current Processing Status
- **Transcription**: 726/728 files completed (99.7%), 2 files marked as qa_failed
- **English Translation**: 726/728 files completed (99.7%)
- **German Translation**: 722/728 files completed (99.2%), 6 files marked as qa_failed
- **Hebrew Translation**: 722/728 files completed (99.2%), 6 files marked as qa_failed

### Current Issues
1. **Script Proliferation**: Multiple small "fix-it" scripts making project navigation difficult
2. **Path Handling**: Inconsistent handling of spaces and special characters in paths
3. **Error Recovery**: Ad-hoc approach to recovering from failures
4. **Database Inconsistencies**: Status tracking in database sometimes out of sync with file system
5. **Problematic Files**: Some files with silence or unusual content causing processing failures

## Improvement Plan

### Phase 1: Clean Up and Refactor (Immediate)

#### 1.1 Script Consolidation
- **Core Scripts** (Keep as-is):
  - `parallel_transcription.py`: Main transcription processor
  - `parallel_translation.py`: Main translation processor
  - `monitor_and_restart.py`: Long-running process monitor

- **Create Database Maintenance Module**:
  - Develop `db_maintenance.py` with functions:
    - `fix_stalled_files()`: Update stalled processing statuses
    - `fix_path_issues()`: Correct problematic file paths
    - `mark_problem_files()`: Mark consistently failing files
    - `verify_consistency()`: Check filesystem vs database consistency
  - Replace: `fix_stalled_files.py`, `fix_path_issues.py`, `fix_problem_translations.py`

- **Create Pipeline Management Module**:
  - Develop `pipeline_manager.py` with classes/functions:
    - `PipelineMonitor`: Track progress across all stages
    - `ProblemFileHandler`: Special handling for difficult files
    - `CommandLine`: CLI interface for all pipeline operations
  - Replace: `transcribe_problematic_files.py`, `translate_all_remaining.py`
  - Replace all Bash scripts: `monitor_progress.sh`, `process_remaining_files.sh`

#### 1.2 Path Handling Improvements
- Update file path handling to properly handle spaces and special characters
- Use `pathlib.Path` objects and raw strings consistently
- Apply proper shell escaping for all external commands
- Normalize Unicode characters in paths

#### 1.3 Error Handling Improvements
- Add detailed error logging with file details, error context
- Implement staged retry mechanisms with backoff
- Create comprehensive transaction management for database updates

#### 1.4 Documentation Updates
- Document all main scripts and modules
- Add usage examples for common operations
- Create troubleshooting guide for common issues

### Phase 2: Complete Processing (Next Step)

#### 2.1 Finish Transcription
- Identify and preprocess remaining problematic files:
  - Check for prolonged silence and trim if needed
  - Verify file integrity
  - Re-attempt with enhanced error handling

#### 2.2 Complete Translations
- Process remaining translations with:
  - Explicit language specification (no auto-detection)
  - Enhanced timeout settings
  - Segment size optimization
- Monitor in real-time for immediate issue resolution

#### 2.3 Verify Outputs
- Cross-check all output files against database status
- Verify file formats and encoding
- Update database for any inconsistencies found

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance (Final Step)

#### 3.1 Automated Quality Checks
- Implement automated quality scoring for:
  - Transcription accuracy (sample-based)
  - Translation quality (sample-based)
  - File completeness (full-coverage)

#### 3.2 Manual Review Process
- Establish workflow for problematic file review
- Create annotation system for quality issues
- Document QA findings for future improvements

#### 3.3 Final Reporting
- Generate comprehensive project report including:
  - Success rates by file type/language
  - Error analysis and patterns
  - Processing time metrics
  - Recommendations for future optimizations

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Immediate (Next 24-48 Hours)**:
   - Script consolidation for cleaner project structure
   - Fix path handling issues to prevent future failures
   
2. **Short-term (3-5 Days)**:
   - Complete all remaining transcriptions and translations
   - Verify outputs for all completed files
   
3. **Medium-term (1-2 Weeks)**:
   - Conduct comprehensive quality assurance
   - Generate final project report

## Original Architecture & Maintainability Plan

- **Consolidate Duplication**
  - Extract shared logic (argument parsing, config loading, error handling) into library modules to avoid repeated code across scripts.
- **Centralized Configuration**
  - Define a schema (e.g., with Pydantic or Dynaconf) for all settings (API keys, timeouts, workers, paths) and load from a single source.
- **Monitoring & Metrics**
  - Instrument processing stages with timing and throughput metrics (e.g., Prometheus, structured logs) to identify bottlenecks and failures.
- **Versioning & Release Management**
  - Adopt [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), maintain a `CHANGELOG.md`, and tag releases in Git.
