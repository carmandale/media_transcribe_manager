# Refactoring Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to the Scribe codebase refactoring effort.

## Documents

- **COMPREHENSIVE_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md**: Strategic roadmap outlining the high-level phases and goals of the improvement plan.
  
- **refactoring_plan.md**: Tactical implementation details including specific function signatures, standardization approaches, and implementation schedule.

## Path Handling Note

All path handling in the refactored codebase will use:

1. `pathlib.Path` objects instead of string concatenation
2. Proper quoting for shell commands with subprocess list format instead of shell=True
3. Unicode normalization for special characters
4. Consistent handling of spaces and special characters

## Implementation Priorities

1. Script consolidation
2. Path handling standardization
3. Error recovery improvements
4. Database consistency verification

Progress on the implementation will be tracked here.
