ðŸ§  AI Model Comparison (API)

Model	Quality (Reasoning & Creativity)	Speed	Price (per 1M tokens)	Context Window	Notes
GPT-3.5 Turbo	Good	âš¡ Fast	$0.50 in / $1.50 out	16K	Best value for fast + decent quality
GPT-4o	Excellent (near Claude 3 Opus)	âš¡âš¡ Very Fast	$5 in / $15 out	128K	Multimodal, real-time use cases
GPT-4o Mini	Moderate	âš¡âš¡ Very Fast	$1 in / $3 out	128K (likely)	API availability unclear (still limited rollout)
GPT-4.1 (legacy)	Excellent	âš¡ Moderate	$10 in / $30 out	128K	Being phased out in favor of GPT-4o
Claude 3 Opus	Best-in-class reasoning	âš¡ Moderate	$15 in / $75 out	200K	Tops benchmarks, ideal for dense tasks
Claude 3 Sonnet	Great	âš¡âš¡ Fast	$3 in / $15 out	200K	Great Claude default model
Grok-3 (xAI)	Moderate-good	âš¡âš¡ Fast	Not publicly priced	128K (rumored)	Tied closely to X (Twitter); limited API
Gemini 1.5 Pro	Excellent reasoning + tool use	âš¡âš¡ Fast	Free / low cost	1M (streaming)	Great for long-context use, but pricing varies by platform
