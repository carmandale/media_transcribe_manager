Act autonomously. Your goal is to resolve the failed transcriptions for these two file_ids:
- 0e39bce9-8fa7-451a-8a50-5a9f8fc4493f
- 4a7415b3-31f8-40a8-b326-5092c0b05a81

If any errors, bugs, or missing files are encountered, debug them automatically.

You are authorized to:
- Run any scripts or SQL commands
- Inspect any logs
- Modify code if necessary
- Create or overwrite local test outputs
- Retry failed operations
- Summarize what you've done

DO NOT wait for my confirmation. Just proceed step by step and resolve the issues until the files transcribe successfully.

Project Summary â€” Scribe Transcription/Translation Pipeline (as of 2025-05-09)

Objective:
Manage and process 728 media files through transcription and multilingual translation (EN, DE, HE) with structured logging, retry logic, and database tracking.

Status:
- âœ… Transcriptions completed: 726
- ðŸŸ¡ Transcriptions in progress: 2 (file_ids: 0e39bce9-8fa7-451a-8a50-5a9f8fc4493f, 4a7415b3-31f8-40a8-b326-5092c0b05a81)
- âœ… English translations: 726 completed, 2 QA failed
- âœ… German translations: 722 completed, 6 QA failed
- âœ… Hebrew translations: 722 completed, 6 QA failed
- âœ… Cleanup complete:
  â€¢ Root-level `.log` files moved to `logs/` (or deleted if duplicate)
  â€¢ Old documents archived in `docs/_ARCHIVE/`
  â€¢ README and STATUS.md updated with maintenance section

Recent Work:
- Fixed broken relative imports across `scribe_manager.py`, `pipeline_manager.py`, and other modules
- Implemented `retry_in_progress.py` to re-run failed or pending transcriptions
- Patched retry logic to reference `original_path` from `media_files` table instead of nonexistent `file_path`
- Attempted retries showed 0 successes, likely due to underlying file issues

Next Steps:
1. Inspect `logs/` (e.g., `pipeline_manager.log`, `transcription.log`) for errors on file_ids above
2. Manually fix corrupted or missing files if needed
3. Re-run:
   python3 scripts/retry_in_progress.py

Optional:
- Reset statuses via SQLite:
   UPDATE processing_status
   SET transcription_status='not_started', status='pending'
   WHERE file_id IN ('...');
