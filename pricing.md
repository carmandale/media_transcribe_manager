ElevenLabs Scribe & AI Dubbing Pricing (April 2025)

Scribe vs. AI Dubbing Capabilities

Scribe (Speech-to-Text) – ElevenLabs Scribe is a speech-to-text transcription model. It converts spoken audio into text with high accuracy across 99 languages, but it does not translate between languages. In other words, Scribe generates transcripts in the original spoken language (for captions, transcripts, etc.), including features like speaker diarization and timestamps, but no language conversion.

AI Dubbing – ElevenLabs AI Dubbing is an automated dubbing tool that translates audio/video into other languages and synthesizes speech in those languages, preserving the original speaker’s voice and emotion ￼. This is a separate process that includes translation and voice generation. Dubbing uses the platform’s text-to-speech credits (measured in characters) rather than the Scribe hour quota. All paid tiers (Starter and above) have access to the Dubbing feature ￼, though usage incurs credit costs as outlined below.

Pricing by Subscription Tier (Creator, Pro, Scale, Business)

The table below summarizes the included Scribe transcription hours, overage fees, and AI Dubbing availability/cost for each plan. It also provides an estimated total cost to transcribe 350 hours of audio with Scribe and to dub 350 hours of audio into one language under each tier (assuming the work is done in a single month and, for dubbing, using standard quality with no watermark). All prices are based on ElevenLabs official documentation and pricing as of April 2025:

Plan	Included Scribe Hours (per mo)	Scribe Overage Rate	AI Dubbing(Availability & Cost)	Cost to Transcribe 350 h(Scribe)	Cost to Dub 350 h(1 language)
Creator ($22/mo)	63 hours included ￼	$0.35 per extra hour ￼	Yes – available. Uses ~3000 credits/min (~180k credits/hour) for dubbing (no watermark) ￼. Costs draw from 100k included chars, then $0.15 per additional 1k chars ￼.	~$122.5 – ($22 base + 287 overage hours × $0.35) ￼	~$9,457 – (requires ~63 million credits; 100k included, remainder at $0.15/1k chars) ￼.
Pro ($99/mo)	320 hours included ￼	$0.31 per extra hour ￼	Yes – available. Dubbing uses ~3000 credits/min (standard quality) ￼. 500k chars included; overage $0.12 per 1k chars ￼.	~$108.3 – ($99 base + 30 overage hours × $0.31) ￼	~$7,599 – (~63M credits; 500k included, rest at $0.12/1k) ￼.
Scale ($330/mo)	1220 hours included ￼	$0.27 per extra hour ￼	Yes – available. Dubbing uses ~3000 credits/min ￼. 2M chars included; overage $0.09 per 1k chars ￼.	$330 – (350 h is within 1220 h included) ￼	~$5,820 – (~63M credits; 2M included, rest at $0.09/1k) ￼.
Business ($1,320/mo)	6000 hours included ￼	$0.22 per extra hour ￼	Yes – available. Dubbing uses ~3000 credits/min ￼. 11M chars included; overage $0.06 per 1k chars ￼.	$1,320 – (350 h is within 6000 h included) ￼	~$4,440 – (~63M credits; 11M included, rest at $0.06/1k) ￼.

Notes: All plans above include Scribe transcription hours as shown, and all support AI Dubbing (with costs charged per output language). Scribe does not perform translation – it only transcribes the spoken content in the source language. AI Dubbing involves translation + voice synthesis, consuming credits (characters) rather than Scribe hours. The credit usage for dubbing is roughly 3,000 credits per minute of audio for one target language ￼ ￼. The cost estimates for 350 hours assume non-watermarked output in one additional language, using each plan’s included credits and then charging for overages at the plan’s per-1k character rate ￼ ￼.
